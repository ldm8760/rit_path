College of Art and DesignARTH-392 Theory and Criticism of 20th Century Art
A critical study of some of the major theoretical and philosophical texts that ground twenti -
eth century art as well as their impact on artists and art historians/critics. Taken together they 
constitute what is presently called critical theory across a wide range of the humanities and 
social sciences, as well as the emergence of an alleged postmodernism. Major issues include: 
the theory of autonomy and self-reflexivity, the structuralist paradigm, post-structuralist and 
Marxist critiques of modernism, feminist approaches to spectacle, semiotics, and the theory 
of the sign, spectatorship, and commodity fetishism, the relation of vision to constructions of 
identity and power. Key authors to be discussed include: Lessing, Kant, Greenberg, Foucault, 
Barthes, Benjamin, Saussure, Pierce, Levi-Strauss, Lacan, Lyotard, Bataille, Debord Baudrillard, 
and Ranci. (Prerequisites: Completion of one course in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 level is

ARTH-400 Seminar: Research in Art History
In this seminar, students will explore a specific topic of research within the field of art his -
tory. The topic will be determined by the instructor’s research focus or expertise, with the 
goal of directly engaging advanced undergraduate students with current research methodolo -
gies. Through readings, intensive discussion, and individual or group projects, students will 
identify and assess disciplinary research methods, and will apply those methods in the inves -
tigation of an issue designated by the instructor, assisting in the production or refinement of 
art-historical knowledge. The topic will be advertised by the instructor in advance of the term 
offered. Note: at least one prior 300-level or above art history course is strongly recommend -
ed. (Prerequisite: ARTH-124 or ARTH-135 or ARTH-136 or equivalent courses.)  Seminar 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ARTH-457 Art and Activism
This course will focus on modern and contemporary artists and artists’ collectives who use 
their work for the explicit purpose of changing society, and who subscribe to the belief that all 
representation is ideological. Students will examine texts that propose a form of activism and 
persuade artists to be responsible for the way they represent the world—and perhaps even 
determine if the goal of art is not to represent the world in the first place. “What is art?” “What 
should art do?” “How can art incite social change?” “Does the artist have any social respon -
sibility?” are just some of the questions raised when art comes into contact with the political 
sphere—especially when that art proposes to make a political or social change, i.e., when art 
becomes action. The artists and theorists that we will discuss are concerned with problems in 
our society that effect gender, race, sexuality, poverty, labor issues, and the environment. Key 
artists to be discussed include Martha Rosler, Kara Walker, David Hammons, Allan Sekula, Mel 
Chin, Barbara Kruger, Hans Haacke, Fred Wilson, General Idea, Guerilla Girls, Adrian Piper, 
and Alfredo Jaar. (Prerequisites: Completion of one course in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 
level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-500 Postmodernism and After: Contemporary Aesthetics
This course explores the history of contemporary art and visual culture from postmodern -
ism to the present. We will focus on major artistic movements such as Pop Art, Minimalism, 
Conceptualism, Performance Art, and Relational Aesthetics. Along with and inseparable from 
aesthetics and media, we will chart the ways in which class, gender, race, and sexual inequality 
have figured into the major aesthetic movements of our time. By reading theory and criti -
cism, discussing artworks across media forms, and researching artistic movements in context, 
students will examine art since the 1960s and its connections to cultural history.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
ARTH-521 The Image
The image remains a ubiquitous, controversial, ambiguous and deeply problematic issue in 
contemporary critical discourse. This course will examine recent scholarship devoted to the 
image—a ubiquitous controversial, ambiguous and deeply problematic issue in contemporary 
critical discourse—and the ideological implications of the image in contemporary culture. 
Topics will include: the modern debate over word vs. image, the mythic origins of images, sub -
versive, traumatic, monstrous, banned and destroyed images (idolatry and iconoclasm), the 
votive, the totem, and effigy, the mental image, the limits of visuality, the moving and projected 
image, the virtual image, dialectical images, image fetishism, the valence of the image, semiotics 
and the image, as well as criteria by which to assess their success or failure (their intelligibility) 
and their alleged redemptive and poetic power. Students will explore the theoretical framework 
of the concept of the image, and critically evaluate these theories within their broader intellec -
tual and historical contexts. (Prerequisites: Completion of one course in Art History (ARTH) 
at the 100 level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-522 Documentary Aesthetics

raphy, and moves on to contemporary art that involves documentary work, ranging from 
photography and video to installations and conceptual art.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)ARTH-541 Art and Architecture of Ancient Rome
Students will examine the visual culture of ancient Roman civilization from the foundations of 
Roman culture through the Late Imperial era. Rome was heavily reliant on images as a means 
of transmitting concepts of lineage, status, and power; students will learn how these images 
may have been perceived in the context of Roman social and political history, and how style 
may have been used as an ideological tool.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ARTH-544 Illuminated Manuscripts
Students in this course will examine the history of illuminated manuscripts, learning about the

ARTH-556 Art Comics
This course will explore how the comics medium has figured into the history of modern and 
contemporary art and visual culture. Students will explore how cartooning, drawing, and print -
making in the 19th century led to the development of early comics and the newspaper comic 
strip, how early 20th-century comics fit into the modernist avant-garde, how postwar artists 
began to use the comics medium as both source material and as a medium unto itself, how 
comics have been incorporated into contemporary art museums and galleries, and how con -
temporary comics artists engage with abstraction, medium specificity, seriality, and the archive. 
The course will draw from an interdisciplinary range of methodologies, from art history and 
visual culture to literary studies and museum studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)

tribal styles, as well as to the meaning and function of various art forms within Native American 
societies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ARTH-573 Conceptual Art
This course examines the widely influential mid-1960s art movement that questioned the fun -
damental nature of art itself by renunciating the material art object as well as the phenomenon 
of art making. The definition of art as well as its institutional framework was thereby expanded, 
and the idea, concept, or intellectual dimension of the work was underscored. Students will be 
acquainted with the philosophical foundations and critical implications of this global move -
ment across a wide spectrum of works and practices (paintings, performance, installations, 
books and texts, photography, film, and video) and its relevance to contemporary concerns. 
(Prerequisites: Completion of one course in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 level is required.)  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-574 Dada and Surrealism
Students will examine the widely influential Dada and Surrealist movements in Europe and 
the United States from 1916 through the post-World War II period as well as their relevance 
to contemporary concerns. Emphasis is on identifying the major works of artists involved in 
these movements as well as their philosophical foundations, critical implications, as well as 
the broader literary and ideological contexts (e.g., Freud, Breton, Lautréamont, Leiris and 
Bataille). A wide range of works and practices (paintings, performance, installations, literary 
texts, photography, film, and ephemeral objects) will be studied, and the work of certain key 
artists (Höch, Heartfield, Schwitters, Duchamp, Picabia, Dalí, Ernst, Giacometti, Man Ray, 
Bellmer, Cahun, Cornell, Magritte, Miro, Oppenheim, Toyen and Picasso) will be analyzed in 
depth. (Prerequisites: ARTH-136 or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-576 Modernism and Its Other: Realism in the Shadow of Expressionism
The idea that the artist expresses his/her individuality and then communicates that “self” to 
the rest of “humanity” through a higher, transcendental language has dominated the discourse 
and practice of modernist art. In retrospect, the art that dominated most of the first half of the 
20th century was of an expressive nature, while art that in any way addressed direct and spe -
cific social issues was banished by the art world’s major institutions. Students will look at the 
circumstances of how Realism became subordinate to expressionism. The course will exam -
ine the roots of both movements, taking us at times into the 18th and 19th centuries, but we 
will concentrate on how institutions like the Museum of Modern Art helped to define how we 
see the history of 20th century art as being predetermined and following teleology. Students 
will explore how modernism’s “other”, namely Realism, survived and gained new currency 
in practices of late 20th and early 21st-century art. (Prerequisites: Completion of one course 
in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)ARTH-577 Displaying Gender
This course brings together two of the most significant strains of recent art historical schol -
arship: the study of gender in representation and the critical examination of exhibitions and 
museums with particular focus given to key examples of curatorial practice from the late 19th 
century to the present day. Through readings, possible museum visit(s), class discussions, and 
guided individual research, questions of gender in exhibitions will be considered in relation 
to other aspects of identity including sexuality, race, and class.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ARTH-578 Edvard Munch
The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) continues to generate a great deal of pop -
ular interest, critical scholarship, and reflection. A painter, printmaker, photographer, and 
filmmaker, Munch was also a prolific writer, well acquainted with the symbolist poets and play -
wrights, as well as the broad intellectual drift of the fin-de-Siècle. He is the one Scandinavian 
artist included within the Modernist canon and his image, The Scream (1893), is an icon of 
the modern age. This course will examine recent scholarship devoted to Munch and the criti -
cal issues that his work addresses. It will also place him within the broader cultural context of 
Scandinavian and European modernism, while examining his impact on subsequent genera -
tions. (Prerequisites: ARTH-136 or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-581 Realism and the Avant-Garde in Russian Art
The concept of the avant-garde is considered by some to be synonymous with Modernism; the 
radical move away from classical forms of representation in the late 19th and early 20th centu -
ries is typical of how one understands the avant-garde. In Russia, the experiments in art from 
the mid 1890s through 1922 are seen as extreme departures from art practices of the earlier 
19th century. Although this art is very often described, like other western art of the period, in 
terms of form rather than with regard to its ideological content, students will examine the avant-
garde’s social and, therefore, political underpinnings in addition to its formal qualities. In order 
to get to the roots of an earlier understanding of the avant-garde, we find in its beginnings the 
writings of Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon, and Olinde Rodrigues. In Russia 
the artists who painted images that represented the social world, and therefore put themselves 
in opposition to the status quo, were known as the Peredvizhniki. Students will connect this 
group of artists to the Russian formal and political avant-garde of the early 20th century and 
to the latter non-conformist artists of the second half of the 20th century that coincides with 
Perestroika and the eventual demise of the Soviet Union. (Prerequisites: Completion of one 
course in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-583 Installation Art
This course will introduce students to historic, contemporary, and critical issues surrounding 
installation art, with a particular focus on changes in the concepts and media of installation 
art over the last several decades. There will be an emphasis on the development of the concept 
of an installation project and its relationship to site and/or audience. Both public and gallery 
spaces will be discussed. (Prerequisites: Completion of one course in Art History (ARTH) at 
the 100 level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-584 Scandinavian Modernism
Students will examine the decorative arts and visual culture of modern Scandinavia from 1860 
to the present, with special emphasis on the social, economic, and political impulses that have 
shaped them. Scandinavian Modern design plays a significant role in the postwar epoch; it is 
equated with such leading brands as Volvo, Saab, Ericsson, Nokia, H&M, Electrolux Orrefors, 
Georg Jensen, ARTEK, Iittala, and IKEA and the idea of progressive, social democracy. The 
myths and realities of its success will be examined and related to emerging cultural and nation -
al identities, as well as its impact on contemporary design. (Prerequisites: Completion of one 
course in Art History (ARTH) at the 100 level is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ARTH-586 History of Things:  Studies in Material Culture

of the artistic achievements of craftsmen and women in the past, with particular emphasis 
on ceramics and metalsmithing. It includes study of Renaissance and early modern earthen -
ware and stoneware as a prelude to the consideration of the history of porcelain and explores 
creative thinking and designing in other traditional craft areas such as fiber, glass, and wood.

College of Art and DesignARTH-588 Symbols and Symbol-Making: Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Art
Students will explore the links between psychoanalytic theory, art history, and visual culture 
with special focus on the work of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and their followers. A central 
aim is to examine the way in which psychoanalytic theory has been employed by art histori -
ans and theorists as a mode of interpretation, as well as to study how, why, and what several 
of the most notable psychoanalysts have written about art. Topics include the interpretation 
of dreams, transference, the Oedipal myth, melancholia, narcissism, abjection, the structure 
of the unconscious, the fetish, Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, as well as out -
sider art, and the art of the insane. Key theorists to be discussed include: Freud, Jung, D.W. 
Winnicott, Melanie Klein, Jacques Lacan, Otto Rank and Julia Kristeva; individual artists stud -
ied include: Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, Edvard Munch, Lars Hertervig, Max Ernst, 
Jackson Pollock, Antonin Artaud, Louise Bourgeois, Mary Kelly and Victor Burgin; in addi -

hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, and health care) on the supply side through the lens of qual -
ity management. Secondly, the course examines customer requirements on the demand side 
by focusing upon how customer experience design shapes customers’ thoughts, actions, and 
decision processes. Students will learn techniques used for diagnosis, measurement, and con -
tinuous improvement of successful customer experience. There are three major sections in this 
course. Section 1 focuses on understanding the paradigm of customer experience, identifying 
the drivers of customer satisfaction, formulating strategies to optimize the customer experi -
ence, and managing service operations through the development of a service blueprint. Section 
2 focuses on the role of exponential technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, aug -
mented reality, virtual reality, and data analytics, in creating exceptional customer experiences. 
Section 3 discusses the creation of exceptional luxury customer experiences, incorporating 
technology, and describing how brands go beyond traditional branding frameworks to create 
luxury experiences.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)HSPT-376 Hospitality Luxury Service Excellence
Luxury Service Excellence requires students to take one or more study trips as part of their 
experiential learning at RIT; this is a hands-on learning course that provides real-life exam -
ples of theoretic constructs. As hospitality luxury is highly experiential, taking students out of 
the classroom will allow them to more fully gasp it. Students will be exposed to one or more 
global luxury destinations, allowing them to experience and appreciate the complexity and 
demands of superior service delivery. Various luxury destinations such as Italy, Hungary, 
Croatia, Austria, United Arab Emirates (Dubai), would be excellent points of exploration. 
Students will be required to dive into the socio-cultural complexities of attaining luxury trav -
el excellence, both from the point of view of product content and the necessities of product 
delivery processes. We will be exploring the cultural heritage as the backdrop for authenticity, 
but also global supply chains as the necessary elements for attaining it. We will explore how 
successful organizations build their products in terms of fashion/design, artisanship, food & 
beverage operations and how destinations preposition themselves to answer correctly to the 
challenges brought about by volatile and fast-changing global trends. Note that if travel abroad 
is restricted for any reason, course objectives will be achieved by visiting domestic and or 
local luxury operations. Additionally, guest lectures and Q&A sessions delivered by hospital -
ity luxury professionals will provide students with exposure to the evolving luxury dynamic.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HSPT-377 Hospitality Luxury Operations Design
The exceptional and changing nature of high-end tourism (experiential, emotional, authentic, 
individualized, etc.) suggests that luxury tourism professionals require a unique set of skills. 
As such, this course will provide students with the theoretic foundations to luxury service 
design, preparing them to operate in today’s luxury segment and enabling them to create and 
manage personalized experiences. Luxury service design is a holistic design process operat -
ing in the realm of constant uncertainty and change, i.e. chaos that arises from the contextual 
nature of personalized service and the ambition to solve problems that customers do not even 
know they have. Consequently, the chaos comes from the customers by default because they, 
by wanting personalization, resent standardization, which in turn means that organizations 
have to rearrange their stratagems in real time around what they hear from their clients. The 
luxury service design must therefore use skills from a variety of disciplines (design, psychol -
ogy, management and process engineering) to develop models of co-creation of unique value 
with each individual customer, i.e. personalized experience in the process of continuous exper -
iment. Tools like market analysis, active listening, analysis of customer behavior, mapping, 
heat-mapping, blueprinting, service marketing, complex service networks and imagineering 
will help to discern the new opportunities for value creation in the convergence of customers’ 
needs and desires, technological capabilities, and organizational innovations, taking custom -
ers beyond their current horizon of cognition.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)

Anthropology
ANTH-102 Cultural Anthropology
Human beings across the globe live and work according to different values and beliefs. Students 
will develop the tools for acquiring knowledge, awareness, and appreciation of cultural differ -
ences, and in turn enhance their abilities to interact across cultures. The course accomplishes 
these aims by examining the relationship between individuals and their communities, and the 
dynamics of ritual, religious, political, and social life in different parts of the world.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ANTH-102H Honors Cultural Anthropology
Anthropology is the holistic science of the human condition, and professional anthropolo -
gists engage in experiential, empirical and humanistic research. Cultural diversity and change 
are explored through the anthropological techniques of immersion (ethnographic fieldwork) 
and cross-cultural analysis. In-depth and comparative analysis of critical issues may include 
transnational migration, ethnic nationalism, racism, changing and clashing views on gender 
and sexuality, indigenous peoples’ rights, religious fundamentalism, genocide, war, hunger, 
famine, and cultural and economic dimensions of globalization. The specific topic varies from 
year to year.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)ANTH-103 Archaeology and the Human Past
Archaeology is the study of the human past, from the origin of our species through to the 
development of modern, industrial states by means of the physical remains of past human 
behavior. In studying the past, archaeology seeks to explain how we, modern humans, came 
to be. This course investigates how archaeologists study the past, explains how human society 
has changed over time, and presents an overview of world prehistory. Specific topics include 
the evolution of modern humans, the peopling of the world, the development of agriculture, 
the rise of state-level societies, and associated social and material technologies such as writ -
ing and urbanism. Case studies will be used throughout to demonstrate how archaeological 
research is conducted and how archaeologists use their research to formulate explanations of 
the past that have relevance for the present.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ANTH-104 Language and Linguistics
Language has a crucial role in our lives as a functional system of human communication. 
Language is central to our cultures and societies. This course provides an introduction to the 
field of linguistics. It considers both how language is described and analyzed by linguists and 
how evidence from language can shed light on a variety of social, cultural, and cognitive phe -
nomena. The course provides an orientation both to human language and the field of linguistics. 
It introduces the languages of the world, how languages have been described, the diversity in 
language structure, the issue of language endangerment and death, and the efforts to document 
and preserve the world’s languages, among other topics.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-105 Humans, Health, Technology
You want to be a health care provider. You want to design health technologies. You want to help 
people and these seem like the best options. Helping people, though, requires understanding 
those people and the contexts in which those people live, work, and play. This means ques -
tioning how socioeconomic, infrastructural, financial, racial, cultural, gendered and political 
dynamics shape who gets sick, who accesses technology, and who is healthy, the entangling 
of which manifests in healthcare disparities. In this course we will evaluate how emergent 
technologies affect human health and healthcare disparities. Evaluating impact requires con -
sidering the ethical stakes involved in technological development and application. Our guiding 
questions will be threefold: How do cultural expectations about health shape the pursuit of 
technologies and medicine? and What are the impacts of particular technologies on human 
health? How can we ethically evaluate those impacts? To these ends, we will consider various 
research forms, including ethnographies, that focus on the intersection of culture, technology, 
and health. First, we will orient to technology and health through the lens of social construc -
tion. Second, we will situate ourselves in feminist approaches to biotechnologies; including 
critical studies of epigenetics, using core concepts of kinship and gender. We will then explore 
specific technologies, such as spirometers to oximeters to pharmaceuticals more generally, 
heeding particular attention to inequalities in areas like race. Finally, we explore the various 
methodologies available to those designing biotechnologies derived from the social sciences. In 
each section, we will identify core ethical questions faced by engineers, designers and health -
care providers in their daily work while brainstorming ways that these ethical issues might be 
resolved to improve human health.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ANTH-151 Honors First Year Seminar: Exploring Food, Drink, and Place
This course introduces students to the relations between food, drink, and place. Food produc -
tion, circulation, and consumption will be examined critically through examining their local 
and global import and the assumptions that inform different food systems. Alternatives to 
industrialized food will be explored through both organic foods and the slow food revolution. 
Other themes to be examined will be food and identity, social class, and gender in particular. 
Students will have the opportunity to sample diverse cuisines and to discuss their relation to 
both place and culture. Field trips will be taken to the Rochester Public Market and to various 
Rochester urban gardens.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ANTH-201 The Ethnographic Imagination
This course explores the politics and poetics of writing about society and culture. Writing is a 
form of power, in that our representations of people influence the way that others think about 
and act toward them. The way that social researchers write is therefore shot through with ethi -
cal implications and weighty decisions. Critical issues include whether people are objectified, 
cast as wholly Other, culture-bound or creative, out of the past or coeval, racialized or of a com -
mon humanity, problematic or multifaceted, passive or agentive, mystified or perceptive, and 
mechanical or extraordinary. Writing about society and culture is also poetic. We can convey 
something of people's life experiences, thoughts, agency, and the constraints within which they 
lead their lives. How well we do so depends upon our ethical reflexivity and attention to the 
poetics of language. In this course, we will consider these ethical questions, read experimental 
texts, and discuss how writing style implicitly conveys social theory. (Prerequisites: Successful 
completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) or International and 
Global Studies (INGS) is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)128 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsANTH-210 Culture and Globalization
By exploring critical issues of globalizing culture, we examine how ideas, attitudes, and values 
are exchanged or transmitted across conventional borders. How has the production, articula -
tion, and dissemination of cultural forms (images, languages, practices, beliefs) been shaped 
by global capitalism, media industries, communication technologies, migration, and tourist 
travels? How are cultural imaginaries forged, exchanged, and circulated among a global con -
sumer public? How has the internationalizing of news, computer technologies, video-sharing 
websites, blogging sites, and other permutations of instant messaging served to accelerate 
cultural globalization? Students will be introduced to anthropological perspectives on cultural 
globalization, the transmission of culture globally, and the subsequent effects on social worlds, 
peoples, communities, and nations.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ANTH-215 Field Methods in Archaeology
This course introduces students to the methods of archaeological fieldwork. The course begins 
with the student’s development of a research question and design. We then explore the feasibil -
ity of this research through the examination of sampling techniques, site survey, and excavation. 
Field methods of recording, photography, and artifact conservation will also be discussed. 
Students will be able to analyze the usefulness of the field techniques in light of the archaeologi -
cal scientific methods for dating, and organic and inorganic analyses. Students should emerge 
from the course understanding the values of the techniques necessary for proper archaeological 
excavation towards the reconstruction of the past and the development of an understanding 
of our present.  Lab, Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-220 Language and Culture: Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology
Language is a core element of culture, both as a repository of meaning, and also because it 
is the primary means through which humans carry out social relationships, share ideas, and 
contest received understandings. Linguistic anthropology investigates this interplay between 
language and culture. Topics will vary by semester, and may include metaphor and narrative; 
language acquisition in relationship to childhood socialization; language, thought, and world -
view; language and identity; multilingualism; the social contexts of language change; literacy; 
and the politics of language use and language ideologies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-230 Buried Treasure: Archaeology in Popular Culture
People have been interested in their ancestors and the lives of past people likely for as long as 
we have been human. But this interest has rarely been disinterested. People have exploited, 
destroyed, or ignored the remains of previous societies. And how the past is understood has 
profound effects that ripple through all of society, at different times influencing group identity, 
political philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and film. The emergence of scientific archae -
ology in the last 150 years has created its own cultural references, including Indiana Jones and 
Lara Croft. Each semester this course is offered, a specific topic will examine the cultural con -
text in which archaeologists do their work, what is made of their efforts, and how these are 
related to larger issues in society.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-235 Immigration to the U.S.
This course examines immigration to the U.S. within the context of globalization. We examine 
the push- and pull-factors that generate immigration, and changing immigration policies and 
debates. We consider how changes in the American workplace have stimulated the demand for 
foreign workers in a wide range of occupations, from software engineer to migrant farmworker 
and nanny. We review the cultural and emotional challenges of adapting within the American 
cultural landscape, transnationalism and connections with the homeland, the experiences of 
refugees, and how immigration has changed since 9/11. Special attention is given to immi -
gration from Latin America, the largest sending region.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-244 Human Centered Design Queries: An Anthropological Approach
How do we imagine the people that we design for? How do social differences around race, 
gender and class impact how we design for others? How is design a cultural process? How can 
ethnography make for better design? This course introduces the fundamentals of the field of 
design anthropology. The course explores how designers—from industrial designers, game 
designers to biomedical engineers—can use research-based practices to design better, reflect -
ing the RIT mission to “leverage the power of technology, the arts, and design for the greater 
good.” We will begin by orienting ourselves to design thinking, exploring key conceptual 
frameworks from feminist scholarship, science and technology studies, (dis)ability studies 
and approaches to the social aspects of technical thinking. We will then explore different design 
domains, including urban planning, furniture design, access technology, and user experience 
design. Throughout the term we will learn about how ethnographic methods can create human-
centered design by starting with lived experiences, exploring power relations and ultimately 
learning about the perspectives of those whom we design for.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)ANTH-245 Ritual and Performance
The world’s cultural diversity is most vividly and dynamically displayed through ritual and fes -
tival. Ritual is anything but superfluous; rather, some of the most important work of culture is 
accomplished through the performance of ritual. Through cross-cultural comparison, by way 
of readings and films, we explore the following dimensions of ritual: symbols, embodiment, 
emotion, discipline, contestation of tradition and authenticity, and the orchestration of birth, 
childhood socialization, gender, maturation, marriage, community, hierarchy, world renewal, 
and death. Written expression is enhanced through drafting, revision, and peer review.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ANTH-246 Gender and Health
This course examines connections between gender and health that are both conceptual and 
empirical. Students will explore the causes of gender-based differences in health outcomes 
through case studies of sexual and reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS epidemics and violence. 
Students will also examine global gender and health trends. The course concludes with an 
examination of gender inequity in health care and policy implications of these inequities.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ANTH-250 Themes in Archaeological Research
One of the most fascinating dimensions of archaeology is the discovery that people have done 
essentially the same things in different places and different times, independently of develop -
ments elsewhere. Agriculture, writing, urbanism, complex economies, and so on, all have been 
independently invented multiple times in different parts of the world. This fact raises some 
intriguing questions about what it means to be human. By comparing how these developments 
occurred in different places and times, archaeologists can, in a sense, perform experiments 
on the past. Each semester this course is offered we will focus on a separate theme in archae -
ological research, such as the transition to agriculture; production, trade, and exchange; the 
origin of writing; imperialism, colonialism, and warfare; pseudoscience/pseudoarchaeology; 
or human evolution. We will study competing theoretical perspectives and different world 
regions to gain a broad understanding of the theme and how both theory and data are used to 
create a comprehensive understanding of the human past.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ANTH-255 Regional Archaeology
Since the first humans set out from Africa nearly two million years ago, our ancestors and rela -
tives managed to settle in almost every continent. Wherever they went, they left traces of their 
lives that are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years deep. We call these traces 
the archaeological record. Almost everywhere our ancestors settled, they did many of the same 
things, such as inventing agriculture, cities, writing, and state-level societies. However, they 
did this in ways unique to each region and time. This course examines the archaeology of a 
specific region, such as the Middle East, Mesoamerica, North America, or East Asia, in detail. 
We examine the geography, culture, archaeological record, and significance of the region to 
various key themes in archaeological research with respect to other world regions.  Lecture 3,

This course examines the persistence and change in Native American cultures using archaeo -
logical, ethnohistorical, socioeconomic, ethnographic, linguistic, and autobiographical sources 
among others. In addition to broad regional and historical coverage, we will read about and 
discuss culture change, colonialism, federal law, gender, race, and places in Native American 
contexts. Our goal is to understand the lived experiences of Indian people and the many forces 
that shape Native American lives.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ANTH-265 Native Americans in Film
This course will examine the parallels of anthropological works and resulting government poli -
cies in the late-19th and 20th centuries as they relate to the genre of Native Americans film, 
both popular and ethnographic works. In addition, an extensive regional and historical litera -
ture review will complement the possible films.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ANTH-270 Cuisine, Culture and Power
Physically, culturally, and socially, humans live through food and drink. Spanning the globe, as 
nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating 
food and taking advantage of local environments. We also put food to work for us socially by 
creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities, 
and through luxury choices, demonstrate our "taste" and lay claim to elite status. Through the 
cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food and 
drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal immigra -
tion, and have laid waste to the environment. In this class, we explore physical, cultural, social, 
political, and economic dimensions of food and become more aware of how the private, intimate 
act of a bite connects us to the rest of humanity.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  129
College of Liberal ArtsANTH-275 Global Islam
This course examines the spread of Islam beyond its origins in the Middle East, and the cultural 
and social clashes, but also the mutual adjustments that have followed. This course explores 
core tenets of Islam, but also how its practices and beliefs are altered as practitioners in differ -
ent countries alternately adopt, co-opt, massage, react to, and reject elements in accordance 
with the meaningful social, cultural, and political lives they build for themselves. The compat -
ibility of Islam with Western society is often debated in contemporary public discourse. This 
debate is typically marked by an assumption that Islamic beliefs clash with Western secular 
democratic ideals, an assumption which results in tensions over mosque building, headscarves, 
and other public signs of Islamic faith. We will explore the diverse ways of being Muslim from 
a cross-cultural perspective and the sometimes-challenging negotiation of fulfilling these reli -
gious tenets while living in Muslim-minority places.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-295 Global Public Health
Global health is a term that reflects a complex series of problems, policies, institutions and aspi -
rations that have only recently made their way to the global stage. From its earliest days, global 
health was guided by principles in public health that situate the nation-state as responsible for 
the health of its population. While international health and tropical medicine, the precursors 
to global health, was driven by the distinction between wealthy and poor nations, global health 
today, as this course explores, is oriented to the unequal burden of disease around the world. 
The course will consider major global health challenges, programs, and policies through an inte -
grated social science lens. After placing global health in historical context, we will focus on how 
the science of disease cannot be dissociated from the social context and policies that both drive 
the emergence of disease(s) and respond to the unequal burden of disease around the world. 
We will analyze current and emerging global health priorities, including emerging infectious 
diseases, poverty, conflicts and emergencies, health inequity, health systems reforms, and major 
global initiatives for disease prevention and health promotion.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ANTH-301 Social and Cultural Theory
This course explores influential classical and contemporary theories regarding society and cul -
ture. Students will assess the utility of different theories in addressing key enduring questions 
regarding human behavior, the organization of society, the nature of culture, the relationship 
between the individual and society, social control and social conflict, social groups and social 
hierarchy, the operation of power, cultural and social change, and the interplay between the 
global and the local. Theories will be marshaled to shed light on contemporary social and cultur -
al phenomena and problems such as crime, violence, exploitation, modernity, and globalization. 
(Prerequisites: Successful completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) 
or International and Global Studies (INGS) is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-302 Qualitative Research
Learning about social and cultural groups is a complex and ethically sensitive process. We 
explore common qualitative research methods for social and cultural research. We evalu -
ate the utility of such methods for different purposes and contexts, including cross-cultural 
contexts. We consider common ethical dilemmas in research with human subjects, the ethi -
cal responsibilities of researchers, and common techniques for minimizing risks to subjects. 
(Prerequisites: Successful completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) 
or International and Global Studies (INGS) is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-303 Statistics in the Social Sciences
The research conducted by sociologists and anthropologists generates large, complex data 
sets that are difficult to interpret subjectively. We will explore the basic quantitative tools that 
sociologists and anthropologists can use to understand these data sets and learn how to craft a 
research question and research design that utilize quantitative data, how to select appropriate 
quantitative techniques and apply them, how to present results, and how to critically evaluate 
quantitatively based knowledge claims.  Lab 2, Lecture 2, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-310 African Film
This course considers the diversity, contours and synergies of African films and filmmak -
ing, traversing the continent to view films from Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya, Egypt and Mali. Though much scholarship has focused 
on influential African filmmakers and nationally located cinemas, the straight-to-video systems 
of the 1980s and 1990s had a profound impact on African films and filmmaking. Nollywood 
and other video film industries began to dominate film production and transnational mobil -
ity, influencing new film technologies and industries, accessibility and addressability across 
the globe. Topics in this course include the influence of African film directors on filmmaking, 
and critical developments in major industries; Nollywood and beyond, and the cultural aesthet -
ics, politics and economics that affect their global mobility and popular appeal; postcolonial 
identities and power; music and oral traditions of storytelling; didactic, post-colonial cinema 
with moral, political missions vs. ‘arthouse’ approaches; Afrofuturist and speculative cinema; 
channels such as African Magic that are shown in more than 50 African countries; and the 
effects of video streaming on global stardom and popularity. Students will learn about diverse 
African films and approaches to filmmaking, and the vibrant people and creative cultures that 
make up these film industries.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)ANTH-312 People Before Cities
More than half the global population today lives in densely populated urban areas, which 
are further surrounded by complex networks of smaller communities. Yet, the earliest cities 
appeared less than 6,000 years ago, a small fraction of time since our species’ first appearance. 
The characteristics that define us as human were forged in radically different social universes 
from those of today. We lived our lives among not much more than 20-30 other people at any 
one time, hunting and gathering our food, and occasionally moving from place to place. This 
lifestyle was so successful and adaptable it endured pressures from more complex societies 
well into the 20th century. Understanding what life was like in such these small-scale societ -
ies is important because the material and social world in which they lived is the foundation 
for societies where food production, social hierarchy, and occupational specialization are the 
norm. This course will examine both the ethnographic and archaeological record of hunter/
foragers from around the globe in an attempt to understand how it proved to be such a versatile 
and resilient way of life and how its successes, in fact, laid the foundation for social inequality, 
complexity, and food production.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-325 Bodies and Culture
Our bodies are more than mere physical entities; they are conditioned by culture, society, and 
history. We will take a comparative approach to the cultural construction of bodies and the 
impact of ethnic, gender, and racial ideologies on body practices (i.e. surgical alteration, muti -
lation, beautification, surrogacy, erotica). We will critically investigate the global formation of 
normative discourses of the body (regarding sexuality, AIDS/illness, reproduction, fat/food) in 
medical science, consumer culture, and the mass media. The course features discussion, writ -
ing, and project-oriented research, encouraging students to acquire a range of analytic skills 
through a combination of text interpretation and research.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-328 Heritage and Tourism
Tourism is a global industry and an important part of the human experience. There are many 
forces within tourism that act upon people’s lives, and in particular their environments, econo -
mies, cultural heritage, and identity. This course will explore tourism and its many dimensions. 
Beginning with an examination of kinds of tourism, this course unpacks tourism’s ancient trade 
and pilgrimage roots as well as its class dynamics of post-industrialization. Other aspects of 
tourism to be explored include strategies and effects of tourism development and production, 
nationalism and cultural identity, commoditization and marketing of culture and the eth -
ics of development, labor and infrastructural changes, social inequalities, ecological impact, 
sustainable tourism, the experience of tourists, ritual and authenticity, and the relationship 
between tourists and tourism workers. This course provides opportunities for cross-cultural 
analysis of tourism sites, for participant-observation of the tourist experience, and for evalu -
ation and recommendation of tourism site development in and around Rochester.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ANTH-335 Culture and Politics in Latin America
What does it mean to be a region forged and defined by conquest? “Latin America” is a con -
struct—a term referring to a vast region of the western hemisphere colonized by speakers of 
Latin-derived languages (including Spanish, Portuguese, and French). In this context, culture 
is political and politics are cultural. Throughout what is now called Latin America and the 
Caribbean, the cultural practices of Indigenous and African peoples became the justification for 
the imposition of European rule, territorial expansion, enslavement, the extraction of labor and 
natural resources, Christian evangelization, and the racialized legal frameworks that facilitated 
it all. This course traces these historical processes and examines present-day legacies of colo -
nialism, including ethnic inequalities, colorism, economic vulnerability, patriarchal relations, 
and social unrest. We consider, as well, the agency of people of Indigenous and African descent 
as they pursued survival with tactics ranging from acquiescence and strategic passing to cre -
ative blending to outright defiance, resistance, and rebellion. Throughout, we look at how art, 
music, dance, literature, and religion have engaged critically with the forces of fascism, revolu -
tion, socialism, dictatorship, neo-imperialism, and globalization.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ANTH-341 Global Addictions
This course evaluates global forms of “addiction” in medical, cultural, national, and transna -
tional situations of encounter. Though primarily a EuroAmerican concept of illness, addiction 
is now discursively and experientially widespread, assuming the status of a “global form.” 
Addiction narratives and experiences shape people and social life everywhere, as scientif -
ic and cultural or national knowledge intersect to form subjectivities, identities of addicts, 
and communities of addicted bodies. Concepts of will, morality, the addicted self and other, 
and living and dying also impact the cultural, national and international infrastructures we 
build—whether and how, for instance, we put resources into medical or criminal justice sys -
tems and networks. A closer look at the intimate lives of addicts thus enables us to consider 
identity boundaries and crossings; addiction languages; family relations and parenting; self-
made communities and social bonds; work at the economic fringes of society; personal and 
institutional violence; policing and navigating enforcement or incarceration; homelessness 
and legal, medical and social service bureaucracies; as well as transnational production, traf -
ficking, forms of addiction, and policing. By the end of the course, students will comprehend 
concepts and theories of addiction, and global perspectives on people living with addiction.

College of Liberal ArtsANTH-345 Genocide and Transitional Justice
The destruction and survival of societies hinges on collective ideas of identity. In times of social 
stress, identities—whether racial, ethnic, religious or national—become critical “sites” of con -
flict over the sovereignty of nation-states, and the legitimacy of social, cultural practices. When 
ideas fail to incorporate people, essentialist categories of identity, historical grievances, and 
accounts of extreme violence become interrelated, potent sources of destruction. Slavery and 
exclusive ownership of resources leave people starving or living in perilously polluted envi -
ronments. Global cultural economies threaten local systems and self-representation. In this 
course, we will take critical, anthropological approaches to studies of ethnocide, genocide and 
transitional justice. Students will assess the destruction and survival of societies, from the 19th 
century slaughter of Native Americans and Amazonian Indians to more recent genocides in 
Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, the Sudan, Iraq, Myanmar, Bangladesh and China. Students will 
consider similarities and differences in the social experiences of mass violence, and the eth -
ics of protecting particular identity-based groups, and not others, in international, national 
and local laws. Students will become familiar with multiple inter-related justice systems, for 
instance, the International Criminal Court, national and United Nations-backed tribunals, and 
local justice systems such as the Rwandan Gacaca courts. Recent developments in legal ethics 
and international law will enable students to see how public sentiments, legal advocacy and 
other social, political processes facilitate enhanced protections for the world’s most vulnerable 
people.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-360 Humans and Their Environment
Humans and their societies have always been shaped by their environment, but as human 
societies became more complex, their relationship with their environment changed from one 
of simple adaptation to one in which they had the power to change their environment. Often, 
the changes they have wrought have had unintended consequences, forcing societies to adapt 
to the changes that they themselves have brought about. Although we tend to think that this is 
a relatively recent phenomenon, humans have been altering their environment since the first 
human societies made the transition to agriculture over ten thousand years ago, if not lon -
ger. In this class, we will use the tools of environmental archaeology to explore the history of 
human interactions with their environments and to draw lessons on how we could manage 
that interaction today.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-361 Sociology of Numbers
Much of the knowledge of our social worlds has been digitized. This course explores how social 
technologies shape our relationships, personal lives, and sense of self. The metric manufacture 
of diversity has produced new forms of population management and inequality. Our biographic 
histories as citizens, consumers, workers/professionals, parents, lovers, and social media users 
are collected as data-bites and assessed in metric terms, thereby forging new sets of identi -
ties. The transformation of people into numerical entities is an act of statistical objectification. 
This process frames the creation of social and racial typologies, and is well demonstrated by 
the US census. Students will investigate the formation of racial, ethnic, and gender identities 
in the context of the accelerated desire to digitize humanity.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ANTH-365 Culture and Politics in the Middle East
With a focus on everyday life in families, communities, and nations, we examine the diverse 
cultures and peoples of the Middle East in the context of political and economic forces that 
have shaped their lives in the past and present. We examine European colonialism and its 
modern-day legacies, including ethnic inequalities, economic vulnerability, labor migration, 
urbanism, and social unrest. We look at how art, music, oral traditions, and literatures have 
engaged critically with the forces of political change and neo-colonialism. We consider politi -
cal activism, religious diversity, changing experiences and expectations of women and men, 
rebellion, revolution, and war, and the impacts of and creative responses to globalization. The 
cultural, political, social, and religious dynamics of Middle Eastern peoples will be discussed 
from a humanistic perspective.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-375 Native American Sovereignty, Culture, and Resources
There is a great cultural, and linguistic diversity among Native American Indigenous Nations 
and their approach to managing cultural and natural resources. This course will explore this 
diversity in addition to the various ways Indigenous nations have maintained and exerted their 
sovereignty. This will be done in one of three distinct topics: 1). American Indian Sovereignty 
- an examination of the historical and political foundations of Indigenous sovereignty and its 
current expressions; 2). Indigenous Economics and Economies - a contrasting of Indigenous 
approaches for building and maintaining sustainable economies with non-Indigenous ones 
combined with the use of economic methods to understand the impact of settler colonialism 
and capitalism on Indigenous economies; or 3). Native American Languages - an examination 
of: the structure and origin of Indigenous languages; the events that have led many Indigenous 
languages to be endangered; and the efforts to revitalize Indigenous languages. For clarification 
purposes: American Indian is used to refer to Indigenous people residing within the bound -
aries of the continental United States; Native American broadens this definition to include all 
Indigenous people residing in either North or South America; while Indigenous is the most 
broadly defined. Indigenous includes all people who identify with pre-invasion and pre-colonial 
societies who consider themselves distinct from the societies now prevailing on those territo -
ries both within and outside the Americas.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)ANTH-380 Nationalism and Identity
Nationalism is often described in terms of strong sentiments and acts of self-determination 
on the part of members of a nation as distinct from the state that is necessarily a territorially 
and politically defined entity. This course will explore leading theories related to the origins of 
contemporary nationalism and nationalism's importance within the context of state societies, 
especially in Europe. The past as an invented historical or imagined reality will be highlight -
ed, as invented pasts contribute to claims for exclusive national culture and both exclusive 
and contested identities. The relationships between culture, literacy, and capitalism will be 
applied to understanding select historical and ethnographic cases of nationalism.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-385 Anthropology and History
“The past is a foreign country,” wrote L. P. Hartley. Anthropologists and historians alike aim to 
understand the experiences of others, the past, and its relationship to the present. Sometimes 
anthropologists and historians work in radically different ways and sometimes their work is 
indistinguishable. What is the difference between historical anthropology and history—and 
does it matter? In a core line of inquiry, historical anthropologists have traced the expan -
sion of empires and cultural transformations under colonial pressures. Such investigations 
yield theoretical insights into the dynamics of systems and agency; the interpretation of signs; 
power, hegemony, acquiescence, and resistance; racialization and the colonial construction 
of difference; capital accumulation; representations of time; and ontology, epistemology, and 
authority. In this course, students have hands-on opportunities to access and analyze digitized 
and published primary documents using anthropological perspectives.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Biannual)
ANTH-410 Global Cities
This course examines the impact of global dynamics on cities from the early 20th century to the 
present. By tracing urban formations from metropolis to global city, emphasis will be placed 
on the making of identities, communities, and citizens in the architectural spaces, cultural 
places, ethnic zones, and media traces of urban life in the context of globalization.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-415 Archaeological Science
Archaeology is one of the few social sciences that lends itself well to the application of analytical 
techniques from the physical sciences. This is due to the fact that archaeology relies primarily 
on physical evidence, artifacts and features, whose origin, composition, age, and manner of 
production can be elucidated through application of the physical sciences. This course examines 
the application of physical science techniques to archaeological questions, including the age and 
origin of materials, how things are made, what people ate, their daily activities, and their state 
of health throughout their life. The course will include in-class labs in which students have the 
opportunity to apply some of these techniques and a final research project in which the student 
picks their own archaeological question to answer.  Lab 2, Lecture 2, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-420 Exploring Ancient Technology
While it is commonplace to describe the present era as one dominated by technology, humans 
have always been critically dependent on technology. Many of today’s key technologies such as 
agriculture, writing, ceramics, woodworking, textiles, glass, and metals were invented before 
the dawn of recorded history. In this class, we will explore these ancient technologies, how 
they came to be invented, how they evolved, and how they were integrated into the social and 
economic life of ancient peoples to become the foundations of modern society. This course 
features lectures, readings, and hands-on laboratories and projects on ancient technology and 
experimental archaeology. Laboratories and projects will focus on how scientists create new 
knowledge about the past by testing hypotheses about ancient technology. The course con -
cludes with either an individual project, such as replicating a particular artifact or process, 
or a class project, such as building and using a Mesopotamian glass furnace.  Lab, Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-425 Global Sexualities
By exploring issues of gender and sexuality in a global context, students will be introduced to 
anthropological perspectives on the experience of men and women, as gendered subjects, in 
different societies and historical contexts, including colonialism, nationalism, and global cap -
italism. In turn, we will explore how cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity are 
configured by race, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Course materials are drawn from 
an array of sources, reflecting various theoretical perspectives and ethnographic views from 
different parts of the world.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-430 Visual Anthropology
We see others as we imagine them to be, in terms of our values, not as they see themselves. This 
course examines ways in which we understand and represent the reality of others through visu -
al media, across the boundaries of culture, gender, and race. It considers how and why visual 
media can be used to represent or to distort the world around us. Pictorial media, in particular 
ethnographic film and photography, are analyzed to document the ways in which indigenous 
and native peoples in different parts of the world have been represented and imagined by 
anthropologists and western popular culture.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  131
College of Liberal ArtsANTH-435 The Archaeology of Death
Death and burial are how most individuals enter the archaeological record and one could say 
that deliberate burial of the dead is the first direct evidence we have for the emergence of ethical 
and religious systems of thought. Human remains, their mortuary treatment, and associated 
material culture illuminate past patterns of social organization, economics, belief systems, 
health, and the negotiation of gender, status, and identity. In this course we explore the scientific 
and theoretical tools used to analyze and interpret past mortuary practices, how archaeolo -
gists create new knowledge about the past through the formulations and testing of hypotheses, 
survey mortuary practices from their first occurrence in the archaeological record, and what 
human remains can tell us about changes in the human experience over time and space. We 
will learn how human remains are identified, how determinations of age, sex, biological affilia -
tion, health, and injury are made, how to interpret formation processes, to interpret associated 
material culture to understand the negotiation of gender and status; how humans have cared 
for the deceased members of their societies at different times and places in the human past; and 
the ethics of studying human mortuary remains.  Lab 2, Lecture 2, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
ANTH-489 Topics in Anthropology

Digital Humanities
DHSS-101 Computation and Culture
The course provides a basic introduction to the application of computation in the research and 
practice of the humanities, arts, and social sciences. The class offers students entry to work 
with archival theory and practice; textuality and electronic scholarly communication; data 
mining, analysis, and visualization; the spatial and temporal “turns;” game studies and digital 
arts. The course offers hands on experimentation with software platforms available to create 
scholarly and artistic production and theoretical approaches to digital presentation. Students 
will complete assignments requiring conceptual, aesthetic, and practical approaches to digital 
engagement with cultural materials. While no programming knowledge is required, students 
will design and create an online project using tools and platforms that are considered standard 
practice in the field, and reflect critically on the utility of digital techniques in their dialogue 
with the humanities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)136 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsDHSS-102 Industrial Origins of the Digital Age
The central focus of this course will be the excavation of textual, visual, and sonic materials, 
obsolete or emerging. The archaeological metaphor evokes both the desire to recover material 
traces of the past and the imperative to situate those traces in their social, cultural, and politi -
cal contexts. How does the digital age imagine backwards to the Industrial Age and vice versa? 
Is it true that virtually everything that is being invented now for a digital age had its origins in 
the late nineteenth and early twentieth century industrial age? (inventions of telegraphy and 
telephony, electricity, photography, cinema, the automobile, the Dewey Decimal and Library 
of Congress classification systems, muckraking and sensationalist journalism, celebrity cul -
ture, the skyscraper, the office, the typewriter, the Brownie camera). We will take a research 
approach that explores moments in which both familiar and unfamiliar devices have yet to 
emerge as significant or disappear as curiosities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
DHSS-103 Ethics in the Digital Era
The course will examine various contemporary and global issues of digital citizenship and new 
ethical challenges raised by digital technology. The course will raise questions regarding how 
digital technology has changed citizenship practices: Who has access to full citizenship, and 
why? What responsibilities are entailed in digital citizenship? Themes may include the nature 
and value of digital technology; the relations between digital technologies and knowledge-mak -
ing/meaning-making; the value of information privacy; the role of digital media in society and 
human interactions; issues arising from the life-cycle of new digital tools and data repositories; 
and questions broadly related to questions of accessibility, representation, and sustainability as 
applied to digital technologies. Topics may also include research ethics, piracy and file sharing, 
hacktivism, copyright and fair use, end-user license agreements, alternative news media, and 
participatory culture. Students will take up both broad ethical issues and specific professional 
codes and policy in diverse domains.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
DHSS-200 DHSS Seminar
This is a one-credit seminar course that assists DHSS majors in their professional development 
and prepares them to locate and obtain co-ops and jobs in their field. It also provides a forum for 
DHSS majors to receive feedback on their own creative projects in preparation for their senior 
capstones. Faculty and students will also discuss emerging events related to the field of DHSS. 
Students may take this course repeatedly for credit up to four times.  Lecture 1, Credits 1 (Fall)
DHSS-377 Media Narrative
The contemporary understanding of communication and narrative is quickly shifting in a world 
where media is ubiquitous. The "language of new media" is the thematic used in this course 
to discuss contemporary and historic forms of non-linear narrative. Students will explore the 
properties of non-linear, multi-linear, and interactive forms of narratives. This course will 
survey some of the possibilities, examining both traditional and new media such as oral story -
telling, literature, poetry, visual arts, museum exhibits, architecture, hypertext fiction, Net Art, 
and computer games. Writers on communication culture, gaming, television, digital aesthet -
ics, contemporary art and film, as well as synchronic narrative will be addressed. The focus is 
to develop critical tools to analyze contemporary media as well as a minimal level of practical 
implementation. Students will produce a final media project.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
DHSS-488 Special Topics
A critical examination/practicum in an area of digital humanities not covered in other digi -
tal humanities and social sciences courses. Counts as a program elective for the DHSS degree 
program, and may be taken as a general education elective if approved by the general educa -
tion committee.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
DHSS-489 DHSS Capstone I
This course is intended for students in the DHSS program to produce critical and creative proj -
ects that apply digital technologies to a field of inquiry in the humanities and/or social sciences, 
while being guided by faculty advisors. Students will acquire a client (faculty member, not-
for-profit organization, or cultural heritage site) and will be supervised by the advisor as they 
develop the research agenda, develop the project management plan, construct all necessary IRB 
materials, intellectual property documents, and copyright permissions, and develop a working 
prototype. This course will culminate in an online publishable project and a written rationale 
with theoretical grounding, as well as explanation of practical decisions and applications. It is 
expected that the project will be somewhat novel, will extend the theoretical understanding of 
previous work, and go well beyond any similar projects that they might have contributed to in 
any of their previous courses. The 6-hour course sequence is designed to be distributed over 
two consecutive semesters in order to allow for long-term, in-depth development of projects.

ECON-100 Foundational Seminar in Economics
This course is designed to introduce new students in the economics program (freshmen and 
external and internal transfers) to the application of economic analysis in academia, business, 
government and the not-for-profit sector. Students will be exposed to the research and con -
sulting activities undertaken by academic economists and economic practitioners as well as a 
discussion of the career outcomes of the alumni of the RIT economics program. (This course 
is restricted to ECON-BS Major students.)  Seminar, Credits 0 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ECON-101 Principles of Microeconomics
Microeconomics studies the workings of individual markets. That is, it examines the interac -
tion of the demanders of goods and services with the suppliers of those goods and services. 
It explores how the behavior of consumers (demanders), the behavior of producers (suppli -
ers), and the level of market competition influence market outcomes.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Fall, Spring)
ECON-101H Honors Microeconomics
This course introduces students to some of the important questions addressed in 
Microeconomics and the methodology used to address these questions. We will look at some 
of the basic models of consumer and firm behavior and study how implications are derived 
from these. We will also see how some of these simple models give insight into diverse ques -
tions such as: Should food stamps be given away freely to those who are poor, or should they 
be required to purchase them? Why are general practitioners (as opposed to specialists) dis -
proportionately located in smaller towns? Why do firms bundle goods rather than just selling 
them separately? As far as the final impact is concerned, is there a difference in whether a tax 
is imposed on the sellers of a product or on buyers of a product? Microeconomics gives the 
tools to understand and evaluate implications of government as well as business policy deci -
sions. In addition, it provides the foundation for the study of many other sub-disciplines in 
economics. (Honors Students)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
ECON-102 Economics, Ethics, and Society
This course introduces students to an historical overview of economic theories and policies 
with special emphasis on their ethical perspectives and implications. The course examines 
the main economic theories including, but not limited to, Classical Economics, Keynesian 
Macroeconomics, Austrian, and Marxist Economics. The course will also examine the ethical 
aspects of Capitalism, Feudalism, Socialism, and other economic forms.  Lecture 3, Credits 
3 (Spring)
ECON-201 Principles of Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics studies aggregate economic behavior. The course begins by presenting the 
production possibilities model. This is followed by a discussion of basic macroeconomic con -
cepts including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth and fluctuations. The next 
topic is national income accounting, which is the measurement of macroeconomic variables. 
The latter part of the course focuses on the development of one or more macroeconomic mod -
els, a discussion of the role of money in the macroeconomy, the aggregate supply-aggregate 
demand framework, and other topics the individual instructor may choose. (Prerequisites: 
ECON-101 or completion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3

This course develops the tools that are commonly used to study the allocation of resources in 
a private enterprise economy. Topics covered include the theory of consumer behavior, cost 
and production, and alternate market structures. (Prerequisites: ECON-101 or completion of 
one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course and MATH-161 or MATH-171 or MATH-181 or MATH-
181A or equivalent courses.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ECON-402 Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory
The central question of macroeconomics is the determination of output, employment, and 
prices. This course develops models which incorporate behavioral assumptions concerning 
consumption, investment, and the role of money and their relationship to macroeconomic 
variables. Macroeconomics, unlike microeconomics, has been in a constant state of flux during 
the 20th and into the 21st century. Theories which purport to explain macroeconomic behavior 
have come into and gone out of fashion depending upon institutional changes and external fac -
tors. This course will primarily focus on examining four macroeconomic theories; the Classical, 
Keynesian, Monetarist, and New Classical models. In addition, macroeconomic public policy 
will be analyzed in the context of recent economic history. This analysis will be extended to 
consider open economy macroeconomics in a global context. (Prerequisites: ECON-101 or com -
pletion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course and ECON-201 and (MATH-161 or MATH-171 
or MATH-181 or MATH-181A) or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)

ECON-407 Industrial Organization
The study of the structure, conduct and performance of contemporary American industry. 
Involves the application of the tools of microeconomic analysis and empirical evidence to aid in 
understanding the behavior of modern industry. In addition, the course considers the histori -
cal determinants of contemporary market structure and the public policy measures designed 
to preserve a competitive market structure. The course concludes with an examination of 
alternative intellectual property rights mechanisms and how alternative mechanisms impact 
firm-level and economy-level innovation rates. (Prerequisites: ECON-101 or completion of one 
(1) 400 or 500 level ECON course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)ECON-410 Game Theory with Economic Applications
Game theory uses a mathematical approach to study situations of strategic interdependence, 
i.e., situations with two or more players in which each player's decision influences payoffs of 
other players and players are aware of this fact when making their decisions. Game theory has 
been applied to understand diverse economic, political and biological phenomena. We will 
study how to formulate situations of strategic interdependence as game theoretic models; how 
to explain/predict behavior of the parties involved, through the use of various equilibrium con -
cepts; and/or identify guidelines for appropriate behavior. The concepts and methods will be 
illustrated with many examples. The objective is to introduce you to language of game theory 
and its methodology, and to develop analytical reasoning skills. (Prerequisites: ECON-101 
or completion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ECON-411 Computational Economics
The objective of the course is to introduce students to computational modeling in econom -
ics. The course is intended for students who wish to learn what role computation can play in 
economics, how to create computational models for studying economic phenomena, and how 
to use these computational economic models to draw insights into economic phenomena. 
We will use programming languages such as Julia, Python and R for modeling and analysis.

and limitations of benefit-cost analysis as a public policy tool commonly used, and misused, 
in comparing the relative merits of alternative government actions. (Prerequisites: ECON-
101 or completion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ECON-430 Managerial Economics
Managerial Economics involves the application of economic theory to business decision-mak -
ing. Most of the emphasis is microeconomic in nature, the theory of the firm and consumer 
theory, but there is some macroeconomic influence, particularly in the forecasting area. Since 
this is an applied economics course, it has a strong quantitative flavor. (Prerequisites: (ECON-
101 or completion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course) and ECON-201 or equivalent 
course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ECON-431 Monetary Analysis and Policy
This course is a study of monetary behavior and the role of monetary institutions in the mod -
ern economy. The primary focus of the course is upon understanding how money plays a role 
in individual decision making units (i.e., households and businesses) and ultimately affects the 
macroeconomy (e.g., output, employment and inflation). The first part of the course begins 
with a discussion of economic methodology including introduction to regression analysis and 
an overview of money and the financial system; the course then proceeds to a discussion of 
interest rates, portfolio analysis and exchange rates. The second part of the course considers 
how money affects the macroeconomy by discussing the money supply process and considering 
theories which explain how changes in the money supply affect the economy. (Prerequisites: 
(ECON-101 or completion of one (1) 400 or 500 level ECON course) and ECON-201 or equiva -
lent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)

We encounter digital texts and codes every time we use a smart phone, turn on an app, read an 
e-book, or interact online. This course examines the innovative combinations of text and code 
that underpin emerging textual practices such as electronic literatures, digital games, mobile 
communication, geospatial mapping, interactive and locative media, augmented reality, and 
interactive museum design. Drawing on key concepts of text and code in related fields, stu -
dents will analyze shifting expressive textual practices and develop the literacies necessary to 
read and understand them. Practicing and reflecting on such new media literacies, the course 
explores their social, cultural, creative, technological, and legal significance. To encourage 
multiple perspectives on these pivotal concepts of text and code and their import, the course 
includes guest lectures by scholars and practitioners in these fields.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-250 Data Methods for English Majors
Designed for English majors, this course provides an introduction to methods used to analyze, 
interpret, and visualize textual data. Students will learn how to formulate research questions, 
collect relevant data, and disseminate findings. Students across tracks will leave the course 
with a toolbox of approaches for applied work as well as critical understanding of method -
ological and ethical considerations of working with textual data.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-260 Written Argument
This course is a rigorous introduction to the formal study of rhetoric. Often defined as the “art 
of persuasion,” rhetoric helps us understand the complexities of marshaling others to see, 
believe and act in particular ways. Reading a range of rhetorical theory—from the ancient to 
the contemporary—students will investigate how language is used to create meaning, construct 
identity, organize social groups, and produce change. Because argument and persuasion inher -
ently involve ethical questions of power, students will also consider who and what benefits or is 
marginalized by particular assumptions, claims and practices. The course emphasizes cultural 
rhetoric and rhetorical genre theory to ask what different types of texts do, what cultural role 
they play in shaping knowledge, and what ideologies they embody. Students will analyze the 
rhetoric observed in a range of media—academic research, public communication, digital mate -
rial, data visualization—and compose arguments, identifying assumptions, misinformation/
disinformation, and counter arguments. Students engage with rhetorical theory to pose complex 
questions about important social issues, consider the discursive requirements of the moment, 
and write intentionally for a target audience.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ENGL-275 Storytelling: [Genre/Theme]
In this course students will focus on reading and analyzing storytelling as a literary practice. It 
introduces the basic elements of narrative and story, acknowledging these as a primary way that 
we organize information and communicate our experiences, whether in fictional or real-world 
domains. The course explores defining characters of narrative expression and storytelling: sto -
ry arcs, conflict, transformation, plot, and structural relationships among characters and also 
between author, text, and audience/reader. Exploring influential commentary on “story” and 
considering significant differences between oral, print, and digital storytelling methods, the 
course invites students to consider how the foundations of storytelling have evolved over time, 
and how new techniques continue to emerge in the present day.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-301 The Art of Poetry
This course emphasizes the enjoyment and study of poetry with primary attention to major 
poetry in English. Students will develop (and apply) a working vocabulary of the concepts and 
terminology used to discuss and analyze poetry, through close readings of individual poems, 
lectures on specific poets, and theories of poetics.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)ENGL-302 The Short Story
The short story has been one of the most dynamic and innovative genres in literature. This 
course uses the genre of the short story to provide material for critical commentary and cul -
tural understanding. Students read a variety for short stories to develop an understanding of 
the form and its impact on culture.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ENGL-304 Drama and Theatre
From Oedipus Rex to Hamlet dramatic characters have come to represent human archetypes 
for millennia. Drama captures both current sociological trends and the universal everyman. 
In this course students will explore the literary elements that comprise the genre of Drama. 
Drama is the only literary art that requires an extra step to come to full expression. Playwrights, 
unlike the novelists or poets, create their work to be performed by others. In this course, stu -
dents will read a selection of plays and discuss questions of historical relevance, reception, and 
ask why this form of literature has been so enduring and socially potent.  Lecture 3, Credits 
3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
ENGL-307 Mythology and Literature
This course is a scholarly investigation into the cultural, historical, social, psychological, reli -
gious and spiritual, literary and performative dimensions of world myth. It examines different 
approaches to the study of myth emerging from disciplines such as anthropology, history, 
literary studies, and psychology. Special attention will be paid to the effects of these narra -
tives on literature and other kinds of cultural texts, past and present. We will also use myth 
to develop, and critically reflect on, comparative approaches to world cultures.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-308 Shakespeare Drama
In this course students will read, study, and discuss some of Shakespeare's dramatic work in 
an attempt to determine the nature of his significance. What political and institutional fac -
tors account for the reverence accorded to Shakespeare? In addition to reading a range of 
Shakespeare’s plays, the course will develop deeper understandings of contemporary literary 
theory and practices that allow various interpretations of these plays. The approach will be 
comparative and reflect on the influence and effect of Shakespeare’s work on contemporary 
culture. Attention will be paid to issues of gender, historicity, iconicity and textual analysis 
among others  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-309 Topics in Literary Forms
This course explores the evolution of an influential literary form (the short story, drama, poetry, 
autobiographical literature, or the novel). Reading a series of variations on this literary form, 
likely bridging cultural or historical contexts or themes, the course develops critical perspec -
tives and artistic insights into this genre of writing. Criticism and theory appropriate to the 
genre will be discussed as a way to understand the form, its social functions, and its cultural 
and political significance. The course can be taken up to two times, for a total of 6 semester 
credit hours, as long as the topics are different.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-310 Introduction to Language Science
This course introduces the basic concepts of linguistics, which is the scientific study of human 
languages. Students will be introduced to core linguistic disciplines (phonetics, phonology, 
morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) and to principles of linguistics through dis -
cussion and the analysis of a wide range of linguistic data based on current linguistic models. 
English will often serve as the reference language, but we will discuss a wide variety of lan -
guages, including sign languages, to illustrate core concepts in linguistics. The course will have 
relevance to other disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and technical fields. Students will 
be encouraged to develop critical thinking regarding the study of human languages through 
discussions of the origins of languages, how languages are acquired, their organization in 
the brain, and languages' socio-cultural roles. Some other topics that will be introduced are: 
language globalization and language endangerment, language and computers, and forensic 
linguistics.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-312 American Literature
This course presents a study of American literature by engaging in critically informed anal -
ysis of texts that emerged from within the geography, history, and cultures that constitute 
the modern United States. This includes work by colonial writers, Native American writers, 
African American writers, and writers from the many other ethnic and racial groups who have 
immigrated to and comprised the fabric of American culture. One of the goals of the class is 
to analyze and discuss the works in their respective socio-historical contexts, with a special 
focus on the ways in which individual works belong to a distinctly American literary tradi -
tion. Specific literary works studied will vary depending on the instructor. The course can be 
repeated up to 2 times, for 6 semester credit hours, as long as the topics are different.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Annual)140 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsENGL-313 British Literature
This course presents a study of British literature by engaging in critically informed analysis of 
texts that emerged from within the geography, history, and cultures that constitute the mod -
ern United Kingdom. This includes work by writers from all parts of the British Isles (England, 
Wales, Scotland, Ireland) and writers from Britain’s vast global empire. One of the goals of 
the class is to analyze and discuss the works in their respective socio-historical contexts, with 
a special focus on the ways in which individual works belong to a distinctly British literary 
tradition. Specific literary works studied will vary depending on the instructor. The course 
can be repeated up to 2 times, for 6 semester credit hours, as long as the topics are different.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ENGL-314 Ethics in the Graphic Memoir
Graphic novels demonstrate a concern for constructed narrative within a visual structure, char -
acter development, and plot strategies. Graphic memoirs, or auto-graphic novels, tell true tales 
of human experiences and global events, exploring the boundaries between fact and fiction, 
public and private, interior and exterior, visual and textual, seen and unseen, traumatic pasts 
and their futures. Graphic memoirs are interested in how these distinctions, and the questions 
of individual and collective truth, transparency, and communicability they open onto, help to 
delineate ethical behavior and belief systems. Holding a mirror up to the multiple ways in which 
contemporary cultures frame and reframe individual and collective experience, graphic mem -
oirs render their subjects’ and cultures’ ethical premises and guidelines explicit, and, therefore, 
enable readers to revisit, rethink, and redraw accepted ways of behaving, understanding, and 
circulating. Texts used in this course will be explored through this lens. We will focus on the 
ethical considerations and concerns conveyed in and by graphic memoirs in order to uncover 
unique forms of book-length sequential art, as well as enhance critical thinking about ethics and 
media literacy skills. Designated as writing intensive, this course emphasizes writing practices, 
recognizing the role writing plays in the formation of knowledge, and the framing of a specific 
academic specialization, as well as genre.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-315 Digital Literature
Since the initial development of the computer, writers have collaborated with programmers, 
illustrators, and soundscapists to create digital literatures. Following from radical techniques in 
print literatures such as concrete poetry, Choose Your Own Adventure novels, and reorderable/
unbound fictions, digital literatures exploit the potential of digital formats to explore questions 
of interactivity, readership, authorship, embodiment, and power. In this class, we will learn to 
analyze and appreciate digital literatures not simply through their content, but also through 
the relation of content to form, media, programming platforms, and distribution formats. Our 
consideration of digital literatures will lead us to cell phones, web pages, video games, virtual 
reality environments, and genome sequencers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-316 Global Literature
This course presents a study of global literature by engaging in critically informed analysis of 
texts from different geographical regions or cultural perspectives. Students will discover new 
modes for thinking about what global literature is, and how globalizing impulses have changed 
and shaped our world. One of the goals of the class is to analyze and discuss the works in their 
respective socio-historical contexts, with a special focus on the theme of encounter or contact 
zones. The impact of various factors such as migration, nationality, class, race, gender, gen -
eration, and religion will also be taken into consideration. The course can be repeated up to 
two times, for 6 semester credit hours, as long as the topics are different.  Lecture 3, Credits 
3 (Spring)
ENGL-318 Popular Literature
This course examines popular literature, a designation that has meant different things at dif -
ferent times and that has included literature as diverse as Shakespearean comedies, Gothic 
fiction, Science Fiction, and Fantasy. In part, students will consider the artistic relationships 
between popular literature and both historical and contemporary literary forms in order to 
understand how popular literature draws upon and sometimes invents new kinds of artistic 
representation. The class will also ask students to explore what social attitudes and pressures 
help to make a form popular at a particular moment in time, and how popularity is often 
driven by the social networks of book production, marketing, sales, and adaptation. Different 
sections may focus on different popular literary forms. Whatever the topic, the course will 
provide students a lens through which to discuss how the public, mainstream authors, and 
literary critics, as well as editors and publishers, impact the development of literary traditions.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ENGL-320 Genre Fiction
Students will learn about foundational texts in one or more category of genre fiction and review 
its development in the 19th, 20th, and/or 21st centuries. Genre is a category characterized by 
similarities in style, or subject matter. Examples include science fiction, fantasy, speculative 
fiction, fanfiction, magical realism, or historical fiction. The course approaches genre fiction 
as literary form, as cultural artifact, and as philosophical speculation; students will learn to 
distinguish key features of genre fiction, including the historical inspiration as well as contem -
porary trends. The course may be taken up to two times for a total of 6 credit hours, as long as 
the topics are different.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)ENGL-322 Literary Geographies
The course uses both literature and geography, artful writing and creative mapping, to explore 
both fictional and real places. From Sherlock Holmes’s 221B Baker St. London and Charles 
Dickens’s 19th century London to J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth and Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea, 
geography is more than an artistic theme, and maps are more than creative illustrations. 
Literary geography explores the ways in which authors work with detail not only to create 
setting but to depict geographical locations. The course will challenge students to understand 
“landscape” as a more than a backdrop. Throughout the semester we will engage with the 
socio-cultural notions of “place”: home and community, borderlands and human migration, 
smart cities and mundane landscapes, territory and tourism. Students may practice plotting 
authors and their works, following the routes characters take across a landscape, or making 
the geography of imaginary worlds visible.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-325H Honors English
A critical examination of themes, topics, theories and practices in a literary or writing studies 
area associated with existing courses in the English curriculum, or with a special topics area. 
The approach to this literary or writing studies topic will be specially geared to honors students 
and others who wish to participate in a more in-depth and rigorous exploration of a literary or 
writing set of topics. (Honors Students)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-328 Rhetoric of Science
Exploration of the many ways in which science employs modes of persuasion, and the ways 
it does so differently in different cases of scientific work. Emphasis will be given to the con -
junction between science and rhetoric; examples will be drawn from key figures and texts in 
the history of science, ongoing controversies in contemporary scientific debates, the popu -
larization of science in public media, and the representation of science in fiction.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring, Summer)
ENGL-330 Rhetoric of Health and Medicine
This course draws from rhetorical theory to explore the many ways in which health and med -
icine is understood, designed, used, and discussed. Students will learn methods developed 
within the field of Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine (RSTM) and apply those 
methods in the analysis of case studies, (i.e. chronic conditions and pain management, infec -
tious disease and modern plagues, mental illness and mortality). The course offers students 
opportunities to examine how language and argument shape the cultural and global forces of 
health and illness, in particular it relates to patient rights, public advocacy and social move -
ments. Students will review rhetorical arguments regarding high-tech diagnostic methods, 
prosthetic technologies, and new drug therapies–and the unequal distribution of health care 
among different populations. Additionally, students will consider the transnational circula -
tion of medical knowledge by health care professionals, scientists and nonscientists, and the 
effect of digital communication on deliberation about health-related issues, arguments and 
controversies. While the course does not assume a background in medicine or health care, 
students will be invited to reflect on their own embodiment and experience of health, illness 
or disability. (Prerequisite: UWRT-150 or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ENGL-333 The Rhetoric of Terrorism
This class examines the history of terrorism (both the concept and the term), definitions of 
terrorism and attempts to explain the root causes of terrorism through rhetorical and ethical 
analysis of narratives written by historians, journalists, and terrorists themselves. Students 
will read and discuss charters, manifestoes and messages (terrorism texts) of domestic and 
foreign, regional and global, non-state entities motivated by politics or religion to commit 
violence, as well as the efforts of analysts to explain and contextualize their activities.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-343 Global Deaf Literature
This literature course explores the deaf elements in select literary works by deaf authors and 
hearing authors from different societies around the world representing various literary peri -
ods and movements. This course begins with the study of ancient writings and laws about Deaf 
people, documenting beliefs and values of earliest civilizations about Deaf people. Deaf culture 
in world literature is largely described by preconceived notions and physiognomic descriptions 
of Deaf people. Stories throughout world history are also characterized by varied responses 
to emerging educational approaches. Significant advances in medicine, science, and technol -
ogy in the 19th century changed conceptions of the moral and cultural values imposed on 
Deaf people by hearing societies. This concept is explored through various literary lenses. The 
course considers global literary tradition for new interpretations of Deaf experiences.  Lecture

College of Liberal ArtsENGL-345 History of Madness
This course will study the changes in definitions, explanations, and depictions of madness as 
expressed in psychiatric texts, asylum records, novelists, cartoonists, artists, photographers, 
filmmakers–and patient narratives. Certainly, madness has assumed many names and forms: 
the sacred disease, frenzy, hysteria, mania, melancholy, neurosis, dementia, praecox, schizo -
phrenia, phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder. Those afflicted have been admired, pitied, 
mocked, hidden from public view, imprisoned, restrained, operated on, hospitalized, coun -
seled, analyzed, and medicated. The brain, particularly the disordered brain, has long been a 
source of interest. This course explores the brain from the history of madness. The course takes 
a humanist, rhetorical, and historicist approach to the question of madness within changing 
social institutions and popular discourse.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-345H History of Madness
This course will study the changes in definitions, explanations, and depictions of madness as 
expressed in psychiatric texts, asylum records, novelists, cartoonists, artists, photographers, 
film-makers–and patient narratives. Certainly, madness has assumed many names and forms: 
the sacred disease, frenzy, hysteria, mania, melancholy, neurosis, dementia, praecox, schizo -
phrenia, phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder. Those afflicted have been admired, pitied, 
mocked, hidden from public view, imprisoned, restrained, operated on, hospitalized, coun -
seled, analyzed, and medicated. The brain has long been a source of interest, particularly the 
disordered brain. This course explores the brain from the history of madness. The course takes 
a humanist, rhetorical, and historicist approach to the question of madness within changing 
social institutions and popular discourse. (This class is restricted to students in the Honors 
program.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-353 Fantasy
This course provides a selective survey of fantasy from its antecedents in mythology, legend, and 
folklore through its transformation through the 20th and 21st centuries. Topics may include the 
development of the genre’s roots in mythology, the epic, and medieval Romance, and folklore 
as well as diverse contemporary forms such as high fantasy, magical realism, urban fantasy, 
new wave fabulism, and slipstream.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-361 Technical Writing
Provides knowledge of and practice in technical writing. Key topics include audience analysis; 
organizing, preparing and revising short and long technical documents; designing documents 
using effective design features and principles, and formatting elements using tables and graphs; 
conducting research; writing technical definitions, and physical and process descriptions; writ -
ing instructions; and individual and group peer editing.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ENGL-370 Evolving English Language
What makes the English language so difficult? Where do our words come from? Why does 
Old English look like a foreign language? This course surveys the development of the English 
language from its beginning to the present to answer such questions as these. Designed for 
anyone who is curious about the history and periods of the English language or the nature of 
language change.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-373 Media Adaptation
This course introduces students to the field of adaptation studies and explores the changes that 
occur as particular texts such as print, radio, theatre, television, film, and videogames move 
between various cultural forms and amongst different cultural contexts. The course focuses 
upon works that have been disseminated in more than one medium.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-374 Games and Literature
Who studies game studies? Writing in games can often be hit or miss, so relying on an estab -
lished story can provide support and allows the medium to evolve to cover more interesting 
stories than the typical mass-offering affairs. Still, literature and games are fundamentally dif -
ferent media- and as such these differences must be accounted for when mapping literature 
onto video games. Will game studies ever be as highly regarded as is critical scholarship on, say, 
literature? Can a video game possess substantial literary merit? Can a video game offer the same 
depth of characters and insight into the human condition as a novel? Do video games invite the 
player to do the same things that works of great literature invite the reader to do: identify with 
the characters, invite him to judge them and quarrel with them, and to experience their joys 
and sufferings as the reader’s own? In this course we will have these conversations and then 
go beyond. We will examine works that have visually evocative and varied settings; narratives 
that make readers wonder what is going to happen next; and a rapidly changing culture that 
prompts even more questions than it answers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)ENGL-375 Storytelling Across Media
This course introduces the basic elements of narrative, reflecting on key concepts in narra -
tive theory such as – story and plot, narration and focalization, characterization, storyspace, 
and worldmaking – to enhance your understanding of how stories work and your ability to 
understand how such storytelling strategies convey their meaning and themes. After an initial 
exploration of storytelling traditions emerging from oral myth and short stories in print, we 
expand our inquiries into what a narrative is and what it can do by considering what happens 
to storytelling in graphic novels, digital games, and in recent electronic literature. Reflecting 
on competing definitions and varieties of narrative, the course raises the overarching question 
of why how we access, read, write, and circulate stories as a culture matters. Expect to read 
stories in a variety of media, to review basic concepts and conversations drawn from narrative 
theory, and to creatively experiment with the storytelling strategies we are analyzing in class. 
No familiarity with specific print, digital, or visual media necessary, though a willingness to 
read and reflect on stories in various media and to analyze their cultural significance will be 
essential.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-376 Experimental Writing
Is it true that literature makes nothing happen? Experimental writing is built on the opposite 
assumption! This course introduces students to innovative texts that challenge our usual ways 
of thinking about the relationship of language to the world: the cultural contexts within which 
language functions, the conflicts out of which it arises, the aesthetic pleasures with which it is 
associated, and the purposes – intentional or other – which it serves. Writing experiments can 
test boundaries and break limits, offering us ways to reconsider and redefine our own experi -
ence – social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual. Moving from magic to modernity, from monster 
to machine, we will explore the transformative power of experimental writing. Students are 
expected to post weekly responses to the readings in Discussions on MyCourses, work with a 
group to research and prepare a class presentation on a significant experimental writer, and 
submit a final paper on a theme to be announced. Expect reading quizzes and a take-home 
final exam. (Prerequisites: ENGL-211 or completion of First Year Writing (FYW) requirement 
or equivalent course.)  Lecture 4, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-377 Transmedia Storyworlds
A transmedia storyworld is a shared universe in which its settings, characters, objects, events, 
and histories are featured in one or more narratives across many different media, including 
print fiction, films, television episodes, comics/ graphic novels, and games. This course will 
focus on the construction of large-scale transmedia storyworlds and how such storyworlds 
expand in size and detail over time. Students will trace narrative arcs as deployed through dif -
ferent media and consider the strengths and limitations of each medium in terms of adding to 
knowledge about the transmedia storyworld. The course will also analyze the differences and 
similarities between transmedia narratives, adaptation, and other forms of serial storytelling; 
the multi-authored nature of transmedia storyworlds; commercial aspects of transmedia sto -
ryworlds; and creative work produced by and for fan communities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-381 Science Writing
Study of and practice in writing about science, environment, medicine and technology for 
audiences ranging from the general public to scientists and engineers. Starts with basic sci -
ence writing for lay audiences, emphasizing writing strategies and techniques. Also explores 
problems of conveying highly complex technical information to multiple audiences, factors 
that influence science communication to the public, and interactions between scientists and 
journalists. The course examines new opportunities for covering science (especially on the 
internet), important ethical and practical constraints that govern the reporting of scientific 
information, and the cultural place of science in our society.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
ENGL-386 World Building Workshop
This course focuses on the collaboration construction of fictional worlds. Students will learn 
to think critically about features of fictional worlds, such as the social, political, and economic 
structures that influence daily life for the characters who inhabit that world. Students will also 
participate in extensive character development exercises, and then write short fiction from 
these characters’ perspectives describing the challenges they face in these worlds. Students will 
critique each other’s fiction and submit revised work. Each class will include considerations 
of sophisticated fictional worlds in print and in other media and discuss world building fea -
tures relevant to teach. (Prerequisites: ENGL-211 or completion of First Year Writing (FYW) 
requirement or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-389 Digital Creative Writing Workshop
Digital creative writing involves much more than simply writing in digital formats - it can 
include computer-generated poetry, bots, hypertext fiction, Augmented Reality, or locative 
narrative. This course is for students who want to explore digital creative writing in all its 
forms. Through reading, discussion, and exercises, students will produce born digital writings 
in different applications. Students will learn style and craft techniques for digital environments 
while also exploring the relationship between content and digital applications. Peer critiques 
will help students rethink their work and become better editors. Programming knowledge is 
helpful but not required. This course can be taken up to two times for a total of six semester 
credit hours as long as the instructors are different. (Prerequisites: ENGL-211 or completion 
of First Year Writing (FYW) requirement or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)142 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsENGL-390 Creative Writing Workshop
This course is for students who want to explore the techniques of a single genre of creative 
writing and add to their skills as a creative writer. Through reading and discussion, students 
will see their own writing in a larger context. Reading/reflection and writing/revision will be 
emphasized all semester. The focus will be on the creation of creative works and the learning 
of stylistic and craft techniques. Ongoing work will be discussed with peer editors, which will 
not only help students rethink their work but teach them to become better editors. Group cri -
tiques will provide the opportunity to give and receive helpful feedback. Each class will rely 
extensively on the creative writing workshop model, and will focus on a specific genre of print-
based creative writing. The course may be taken up to three times for a total of 9 credit hours, as 
long as the topics are different. (Prerequisites: ENGL-211 or completion of First Year Writing 
(FYW) requirement or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-391 Dangerous Texts
This course will examine how suppression of information has been orchestrated throughout 
history in different contexts. The process of suppressing information –of people in power 
attempting to hide images, sounds and words– must itself be viewed in perspective. We must 
recognize acts of censorship in relation to their social settings, political movements, religious 
beliefs, cultural expressions and/or personal identities. The texts that we will study were all 
considered dangerous enough to be banned by governments. They are dangerous because they 
represent sexuality, race, politics, and religion in ways that challenge the current political/cul -
tural norms of their given culture. What, then, is so dangerous about a fictional representation? 
What is it that makes a certain work dangerous at a particular time and how does this danger 
manifest itself in stories, novels (print and graphic), and poetry? Studying these dangerous 
texts and watching some dangerous films we will ask: what features of political and cultural 
regimes do artists tend to single out for criticism? What is the range of expressive tools they 
use, including the contemporary context of digital media? What is it that makes intellectuals in 
general and imaginative writers in particular so potent a threat to established power? Do issues 
like these matter only in totalitarian regimes, or can we learn something about the book-ban -
ning pressures in our own society? How do social media technologies complicate discussions 
of censorship and creativity?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
ENGL-392 Queer and Transgender Creative Writing Workshop
This course is for students who want to practice and explore the vast and varied history, craft, 
and techniques of queer and transgender creative writing. Through reading and discussion, stu -
dents will contextualize their own writing in a vital lineage and in the contemporary moment. 
We will read, analyze, reflect, generate, write, edit, and revise throughout the semester. We 
will create a polished body of creative works by honing those stylistic and craft techniques gen -
eral to the field and specific to queer and transgender writers. Peer editors and group critiques 
will provide regular feedback, which will aid in the refinement of each writer’s own work and 
improve their capacity for supporting a creative work from germinating idea to final draft. 
Each class will rely extensively on the creative writing workshop model, and will survey the 
rich variety of genres, styles, forms, and philosophical approaches that QT literature takes. 
(Prerequisite: ENGL-150 or ENGL-211 or ENGL-212 or WGST-200 or WGST-205 or WGST-
210 or equivalent course.)  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
ENGL-400 Literary and Cultural Studies
A focused, in depth study and analysis of a selected topic in literary and/or cultural studies. 
Specific topics vary according to faculty assigned. (Prerequisites: Completion of First Year 
Writing (FYW) requirement is required prior to enrolling in this class.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Fall, Summermr)
ENGL-410 Film Studies
This course familiarizes students with a number of different critical approaches to film as a 
narrative and representational art. The course introduces students to the language as well 
as analytical and critical methodologies of film theory and criticism from early formalist 
approaches to contemporary considerations of technologies and ideologies alike. Students 
will be introduced to a selection of these approaches and be asked to apply them to a variety 
of films selected by the instructor. Additional screening time is recommended. (Prerequisites: 
Completion of First Year Writing (FYW) requirement is required prior to enrolling in this 
class.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
ENGL-411 Themes in American Literature
The course introduces students to American literature by tracing a particular theme through 
a historical survey of canonical, non-canonical, and contemporary novels, stories, poetry, and 
drama, as well as non-fiction forms (speeches, autobiographies, essays, etc.). Students will gain 
a broad understanding of American literary trends while also gaining a deep understanding 
of the given themes. These themes will be broadly conceived, but will also lend themselves to 
social, cultural, and political questions. These themes may include but are not limited to hor -
ror, gardens and machines, natives and strangers, borders, etc. While these themes deal with 
abstract or conceptual ideas, they lead to questions about gender, race, ethnicity, empire, and 
other historical problems in debates over American exceptionalism, empire, and ideology.

informs our ability to understand many areas of 21st century culture, as mobile interfaces and 
geospatial technologies enable us to engage with our surroundings in new ways. The study 
begins with the history maps and mapmaking, and explores how maps work. As students cre -
ate representational, iconographic, satirical, image-based, informational, and other map forms, 
the course emphasizes the map as narrative. The course develops into an exploration of the 
ways, particularly in texts, that mapmaking creates cultural routes, mobile forms of ethnogra -
phy, and ways of imagining travel and tourism in the era of globalization. The diverse writers 
represented in this course are rethinking space as a dynamic context for the making of his -
tory and for different organizations of social and communal life. (Prerequisites: Completion

course will consider them, as well as the larger social and historical context out of which they 
developed. The course will consider the evolution of the museum as a public institution and 
how the legal system increasingly defined minimum standards for maintaining collections, 
the facilities in which they are housed, and guaranteeing public access; in addition legal stan -
dards for the collection will be studied, including definitions of ownership, what this means in 
terms of intellectual property rights, copyright, reproduction (traditional and electronic), and 
deaccessioning/disposal. These will be studied within the context of the society within which 
the institution functions. The course will also study the development of national and inter -
national ethical standards and will examine the codes of behavior that govern the personal 
and professional conduct of museum professionals and the practices that comprise conflicts 
of interest. Ethical standards for collecting institutions will also be considered, particularly 
those that address the responsibilities to a collection, the ethics of acquisition, the question of 
illicit or stolen material, the issues of human remains and objects of sacred significance, and 
repatriation. Attention will be paid to the changes in society that made these issues critical for 
collecting institutions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)

French New Wave, and heritage films. The course also examines the interconnectedness of 
French culture and the cultures of the United States, England, and former French colonies.

College of Liberal ArtsHistory
HIST-101 Making History
How do historians understand and interpret the past? What tools do historians use to uncover 
the past? What does it mean to think historically? History is both an art and a science, and in this 
course, we will learn the methods, practices, and tools used to create historical knowledge. You 
will learn how to read texts with an eye toward their argument, how to ask historical questions, 
how to conduct historical research, and how to write a historical narrative. At the discretion 
of the instructor, the class may use examples from a particular historical era to ground course 
concepts in a specific historical tradition.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-102 Themes in US History
This introductory-level course will examine the social, cultural, political, technological and/
or economic development of modern America as it is revealed through a particular historical 
topic or theme. The theme or topic of the course is chosen by the instructor, announced in the 
subtitle, and developed in the syllabus.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-103 The City in History
This course offers an introduction to the study of history by exploring the history of a particu -
lar city. Cities are complicated places, where many peoples, cultures, and histories overlap and 
interact. Their histories are also shaped by many forces, such as economic, cultural, demo -
graphic, social, and sexual, operating at levels from local to national to global. Studying a city 
offers a window into the history of a local place as well as a nation. The choice of the city is 
left up to the individual professor. Cities under study in the past have included Rochester, Las 
Vegas, and Paris.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-104 Themes in European History
This course will examine variable topics within the scope of European history. In particular 
students will study the major European institutions, cultures, and societies as they have evolved 
throughout history, for example, the role of religion in European history, the rise of European 
nationalism, the age of discovery and colonialism/imperialism, or the various economic systems 
(feudalism, capitalism, communism, socialism). Students will also study Europe’s relationship 
both with other European powers as well as with the wider world.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
HIST-105 Themes in History
This course is used solely for the purpose of transferring Advanced Placement credit for the 
AP history exams. This course may not be taken for credit.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, 
Summer)
HIST-125 Public History and Public Debate
In late 1994, the B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, the airplane that dropped the first atomic bomb 
detonated in combat on Hiroshima, Japan, arrived at the Smithsonian National Air and Space 
Museum in Washington, DC. The museum’s staff faced important questions: Would they 
celebrate the Enola Gay as the weapon that ended the Pacific War? Would they exhibit it as a 
technological artifact that marked the dawn of nuclear warfare? Would they remind museum 
visitors that its potent cargo ended the lives of tens of thousands of people? These were difficult 
professional questions for public historians; they were deeply ethical questions too. Much of the 
past that public historians interpret is the source of great debate in the present. Since the way 
history is remembered shapes public policy, community identity, and collective understanding, 
the ethical stakes for public history are high. This course will examine notable controversies 
in American public history and develop students’ critical perspectives on them. Students will 
generate answers to the questions: What are the ethics of doing public history? What happens 
when public historians remember, but the community wants to forget? When stakeholders 
(e.g., historic site, community, historians, sponsors) collide, whose stories and whose interests 
prevail? Who decides? How are those decisions made? Who is allowed to tell history? To whom 
or to what are public historians responsible?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-140 History of the Modern Middle East
This course aims to provide students with a general overview of basic themes and issues in 
modem Middle Eastern history. Such themes include the influence of the world on the Middle 
East, the various political, religious, and social movements in the Middle East, and cultural and 
civilizational aspects of Middle Eastern societies. This course will also study cultural encounters 
and exchanges between the Middle East and the rest of the world, including the era of colo -
nialism and the nationalist reaction. And finally, students will gain an understanding of the 
many conflicts in which the Middle East is embroiled as well as their historical antecedents.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-150 World History since 1500
This course will explore of how the contemporary global order in the 21st century has emerged 
from the historical events, processes and trends of the past 500-plus years. Since 1500, the 
world has changed dramatically, from several mostly—or entirely—separate and autonomous 
regions to a single interconnected system of people and societies. We will consider the political, 
social, economic, and technological developments as well as the intercultural and transregional 
contacts and interactions that helped create these changes.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)HIST-160 History of Modern East Asia
Understanding the history of East Asia is integral to understanding the complex world that we 
live in, and will help us to understand that no single nation can live in isolation. One cannot 
endeavor to understand limited national entities alone; rather one must understand the inter -
actions between cultures and across borders that help to define the world. Japan, for example, 
cannot be adequately understood without reference to China, Korea, and one might argue, the 
wider world. Therefore, we will undertake in this course to examine the region of East Asia 
historically from about 1600 to the present, paying special attention to interactions between 
the cultures and people of the region.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
HIST-170 Twentieth Century Europe
This course examines major themes and controversies in European history from 1900 to the 
present, placing particular emphasis on the early 20th century crisis of liberal democracy and 
the political alternatives proposed to parliamentary government: right-wing nationalism, com -
munism, and fascism. Topics will include: the impact of World War I on European societies and 
politics; Popular Front movements in France and Spain; eugenics and the Nazi racial state; the 
Holocaust; occupation and resistance during World War II; decolonization; student rebellions 
in 1968; Cold War domestic politics; and the reshaping of post-communist and post-colonial 
Europe. Special attention will be placed racial politics and immigration, state surveillance 
regimes, and European debates over the Americanization and globalization of European cul -
tures.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-180 Information Revolution
The internet and cell phones seem to have revolutionized our society, changing how we 
learn about new things, relate to each other and understand ourselves. This course investi -
gates the history of information and communication technologies to cast new light on these 
developments. We will ask how people formed political opinions, what ethical concerns new 
information and communication technologies raised, and how technologies changed the lives 
of the people using them. This course helps students understand the social, cultural, and ethi -
cal implications of revolutionary information and communication technologies.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-190 American Women's and Gender History
This course surveys women’s history in the United States from the colonial period to pres -
ent. The course moves chronologically and thematically, focusing on the diversity of women’s 
experiences across race, class, and geography as well as the construction of dominant gender 
norms. Topics include Native American, African American, and Euro-American women in 
colonial America; the Industrial Revolution and the ideology of domesticity, Women in the 
American West; women’s paid and unpaid work; sexuality and reproduction; women’s activ -
ism; and women’s experiences of immigration and family life.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-191 The History of Families and Children in the U.S.
The family is at the center of contemporary political debates involving social policies, gender 
roles, citizenship, marriage, and the role of the state. Politicians and commentators frequently 
invoke a mythical American family, one that is conflict-free, independent, and unchanging. 
These idealized depictions mask a far more complicated and richer historical reality of the devel -
opment of family structures in the U.S. This course will examine both the diverse experiences of 
actual families in the American past, including queer families, and changing ideologies about 
the family and childhood. Students will have the opportunity to write a history of their own 
family, or to complete an alternative research paper.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-199 Survey of American Military History
This course is a survey of military history and will study the interaction between society and 
military institutions, technology and techniques, from 1637 to the present. Additionally, the 
course will examine the interrelationships of warfare, technology and society in American his -
tory. The course will focus on such questions as how changing styles of warfare, the composition 
of the military establishment (militias, citizen armies, paid professionals, mercenaries), and 
the transformations in military technology have impacted upon state and society. Conversely, 
it will also investigate how political and societal changes have influenced the nature of warfare 
in American history.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-201 Histories of Globalization
Globalization is a human process, influenced by contemporary and historical issues that are 
routinely conceived of as affecting or pertaining to the world’s population in its entirety, such 
as human rights, humanitarianism, environmental degradation, trade, and military power. We 
use the world and its population as the unit of analysis with an emphasis is placed on issues that 
appear to be in tension with the role of the nation-state and nationality, and highlight world and 
global citizenship. We explore critiques of the conceptualization of globality and worldliness as 
a factor in determining social, cultural, and historical change.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)156 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsHIST-221 Introduction to Public History
Public history is using the research-based methods and techniques of historians to conduct 
historical work in the public sphere. If you've gone to a museum, conducted an oral history, 
researched your old house, or learned from an interpreter at a park or historic site, you've seen 
public history in action. This course will introduce students to the wide variety of careers in 
public history, and will examine the challenges and opportunities that come with doing his -
tory in, with, and for the public.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-230 American Deaf History
This course explores the history of the deaf community in the United States. It offers a broad 
survey of American deaf history from the early 19th century to the late 20th century. Major 
events in American deaf history will be considered, including the foundation of schools for 
the deaf, the birth of American Sign Language, the emergence of deaf culture, the challenge 
of oralism, the threat of eugenics, and the fight for civil rights.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-231 Deaf People in Global Perspective
This course explores the history of the deaf community in global perspective from the 18th to 
the 20th century. It takes a comparative approach, exploring the histories of deaf people from 
around the globe, including deaf lives in Central America, Europe, Africa, and East Asia. Special 
attention will be given to the major events in European deaf history, as Europe was the site for 
the first schools for the deaf in the history of the world, and the world's first documented deaf 
culture, in France, emerged there as well. The spread of deaf education, the rise of indigenous 
signed languages, the birth of deaf-hood, and the fight for human rights will all be placed in a 
global context.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-238 History of Disability
This course will explore the meaning of disability in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 
course provides a cultural over-view of disability and seeks to explore the social construction of 
disability, with special attention given to the cultural, intellectual, personal, and social histories 
of disability. Disability in history has been many (frequently contradictory) things: acquired 
at birth and acquired by war; a reason to promote eugenic policies or a reason to promote civil 
rights legislation; a medical diagnosis or a personal identity; visible in the body (as in the case 
of amputations) or invisible (as in the case of deafness); a source of family shame or a source 
of personal pride. How has the meaning and nature of disability changed over time? How can 
we understand the cultural meaning of the body in history? The course seeks to explore and 
explain these shifting meanings of disability within the context of Western history. Specific top -
ics to be considered include freak shows, disabled veterans, prosthetic technologies, disability 
as culture, the history of eugenics, and political activism.  Lecture 2, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
HIST-240 Civil War America
This class will examine American politics and society during the Civil War era. In addition to 
military affairs, students will focus on several broader themes, including the political, economic 
and social factors leading to the Civil War in the 1860s; the role of abolitionist, slave expan -
sionist, and black freedom movements in the years before the Civil War; the development of 
emancipation policies during and after the war; and the reconstruction of the union following 
the war. Students will also examine the way subsequent generations of Americans remem -
bered the Civil War in history books, memoirs, and museums.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-242 The American Revolutionary Era
This course will examine the American Revolutionary era as a key moment in both U.S. and 
global history. Focusing on the era between 1760 and 1800, the course will survey the key 
political, social, economic and cultural events in the founding and development of the United 
States as an independent nation. Key topics include debates over American independence, 
the development and meaning of civil society at the state and federal levels, debate over social 
issues such as slavery and women’s equality, American foreign policy and global views of the 
American Revolutionary project and the formation of both the U.S. Constitution and political 
parties at the close of the 18th century.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
HIST-245 American Slavery and Freedom
This class will survey the history of slavery and freedom in the United States from the establish -
ment of global slave systems in the colonial period through emancipation movements during 
the Civil War era. Students will examine key economic, political, and social issues (from the 
development of slave labor systems to strategies of resistance among enslaved peoples) as well 
as the meaning of black freedom struggles during key eras (such as the American Revolutionary 
era and Civil War).  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-250 Origins of U.S. Foreign Relations
This class analyzes the roots of U.S. foreign policy, beginning with the American Revolution 
and continuing through the Spanish-American War. It also examines the development of the 
United States from a small 18th century experiment in democracy into a late 19th century 
imperial power. Topics include foreign policy powers in the constitution, economic develop -
ment, continental and overseas expansion, and Manifest Destiny.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)HIST-251 Modern U.S. Foreign Relations
This course examines the late 19th century emergence of the United States as an imperial power 
and its development into a 20th century superpower. Topics include U.S. politics and foreign 
policy, the influence of racial and cultural ideologies on policy, isolation, and intervention, the 
cold war, and the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-252 The United States and Japan
This class examines the U.S.-Japanese relationship from the perspectives of diplomacy, eco -
nomics, and culture. Fluctuating sharply during its 150 years, this relationship has featured 
gunboat diplomacy, racial conflict, war, and alliance. The course investigates U.S.-Japanese 
relations in the contexts of modernization, imperialism, World War II, the cold war, and the 
21st century.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-255 History of World War II
This course will cover the military, diplomatic, political, social, and cultural history of World 
War II. It will focus on the causes of the war, the battles that decided the war, the leaders (civil -
ian and military) who made the key decisions, and how the war changed society. The purpose 
of the course is to acquaint students with the political, social, economic, military, and cultural 
history of WWII and that conflict's impact upon our own era.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-260 History of Premodern China
This course will examine critically the early history of China: the origins of China, the early 
mytho-historical dynasties, early imperial China, and finally the late imperial era, ending at 
roughly 1850. Students will be able to trace the relationship to the Chinese to various non-
Chinese peoples, particularly the semi-nomadic peoples on the northern frontier. Students 
will also examine the way that China's long and complicated past has shaped its present, and 
how its relations to other peoples has shaped its modern relations to both its neighbors and 
the west.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-261 History of Modern China
China occupies a rather large place in the consciousness of most Americas. It is the most popu -
lous country in the world, it has one of the biggest economies in the world and, in many ways, 
China has been seen to be in direct competition with America. Whatever the truth of these ideas, 
it is clear that China will play a major role on the world stage for the foreseeable future. This 
class will seek to analyze the historical circumstances surrounding the rise of modern China. 
What were the conditions that led to the establishment of, first, Nationalist China, followed by 
the People's Republic; why did the communist government enjoy such popular support; what 
were China's relations with the outside world; and finally, what is the state of China today? These 
are all questions that we will seek to answer in this course.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-265 History of Modern Japan
This course will seek to examine critically the history and culture of Japan and will address 
many of the stereotypes and misunderstandings that are an inevitable part of Japanese studies. 
We will do this by examining a number of materials such as primary documents in transla -
tion, Japanese films, and art such as woodblock prints. In doing so, I will try to present as 
complete and balanced a picture of Japan's history and culture as possible. This will not only 
be useful in understanding Japan and its past, but will also help in understanding many of 
the important regional issues that are confronting us here in the modern world.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-266 History of Premodern Japan
This class will introduce students to the history of Japan from the earliest times to the open -
ing of the country in the mid nineteenth century. Through a variety of readings, discussions, 
and lectures, we'll tackle issues such as the origin of the Japanese people, early state forma -
tion, Japan in the larger East Asian context, and the rise of the warriors. We'll also examine 
the unique dual form of government that existed in Japan from the twelfth century, consisting 
of rule by the imperial court as well as by the warrior class in Japan, the well-known samurai. 
And finally, we'll look at several of the modern myths of Japanese history and try to address 
them in a balanced, historical manner.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-270 History of Modern France
This course explores pivotal themes in French history from the French Revolution of 1789 to 
the present. Topics will include the French Revolution, Napoleon III's Second Empire, French 
imperialism, World War I and nationalism, World War II and the Vichy regime, collabora -
tion and resistance, and the 1968 student rebellions. Special emphasis will be placed on the 
recurring tension between secularism and Catholicism in French society, the role of French 
republicanism in shaping historic and contemporary debates about citizenship, race, and immi -
gration, and France's relationship with its former colonial possessions and the United States.

College of Liberal ArtsHIST-275 Screening the Trenches: the History of WWI Through Film
This course uses popular films to examine World War I as the global conflict that set the 
stage for the rise of communism, fascism, and subsequent wars in twentieth-century Europe. 
Students will gain an understanding of the major causes and outcomes of World War I while 
investigating how the war transformed class, gender, and racial politics in Europe. Special 
attention will be paid to the combat/trench experience, the home front/war front divide, the 
German occupation of Belgium and Northern France, “total war,” the politics of shell-shock 
and disability, and the legacies of grief, mourning, and commemoration. Because World War 
I so greatly divided its participants, little consensus about the war’s meaning emerged in its 
aftermath. Filmmakers have consequently used World War I as a blank slate on which to proj -
ect political fantasies, condemn elements of their own societies, or imagine the future. Students 
will use secondary historical literature and original primary sources to analyze filmic repre -
sentations of World War I and consider how filmmakers have deliberately misrepresented the 
past or constructed particular narratives about the war to serve their own ends. This course 
will therefore equip students to think critically about representations of the historical past in 
popular culture.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-280 History of Modern Germany
This course covers major themes in German history from the formation of the German Empire 
in 1870 to the present. Topics include nation building and nationalism, industrialization and 
urbanization, imperialism at home and abroad, the first world war, the Weimar Republic, Nazi 
racism and the second world war, the divided Germany and the Cold War, and reunification 
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The course may focus on specific questions such as gender, class, 
religion or race and ethnicity. This course leads you to explore how German history shaped 
the role of Germans and Germany in the world today as well as how it informs problems fac -
ing other regions and eras.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-281 Global History of Technology
Modern technologies make our daily lives pleasant and convenient; yet, many people around the 
globe lack access to these technologies. In this course, we will examine the origins and implica -
tions of technical developments throughout human history and across the globe—from digging 
sticks and pyramids, cathedrals and steam engines to atom bombs and electronic computers. 
We will consider the circumstances in which innovations emerge and move from one loca -
tion to another, discuss how technologies influence the ways humans understand themselves, 
and examine how they affected the relations between different societies throughout history. In 
this course, you will gain a better understanding how societies around the world have shaped 
their technologies, and how technologies in turn have shaped them.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-282 Women, Gender, and Computing
Popular attention often focuses on a few prominent women in computing history, such as Ada 
Lovelace, Grace Hopper, and the ENIAC programmers. But many more women were part of 
this history: as inventors, programmers, operators, and users of information and communi -
cation technologies. Investigating their legacies, we will discuss in this course how computing 
turned into an increasingly masculine field, what it meant for women and men to work in a 
male-dominated field, how the gendering of computing technologies and algorithms affected 
the identities and lives of their users, and how gender intersected online and offline with other 
dimensions of diversity, such as class, race, and ability. This course provides the theoretical 
concepts and historical overview that allow for a historically informed discussion of women, 
gender, sexuality, and computing today.  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-290 U.S. History Since 1945
This class examines U.S. history from WWII to present, with emphasis on political, social, and 
cultural change. Focuses on the meanings and boundaries of American citizenship, as well as 
the role of the U.S. in the world. Topics include the Cold War and McCarthyism; the GI Bill 
and the building of a suburban middle class; consumer culture and its critics; The Civil Rights 
Movement; Great Society liberalism; The Vietnam War, the New Left and the New Right, and 
the counterculture; feminism, the Religious Right, and changes in gender roles, sexuality and 
family life; deindustrialization and economic restructuring; globalism and immigration policy; 
the War on Drugs and the growth of a penal state; the end of the Cold War and the New World 
Order; and the War on Terror.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-301 Great Debates in US History
This course offers an analysis and interpretation of the main themes in the history of the United 
States over a broad period of time that extends to the modern era. We will look at how issues 
such as race, class, gender, and the environment have shaped American history, as well as 
debates over the multiple meanings of that history.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
HIST-302 Topics in History
This upper-level course will focus on a specific theme or topic in history, chosen by the instruc -
tor, announced in the subtitle, and developed in the syllabus. The topics of this course will vary, 
but the course number will remain the same, so be sure not to repeat the same topic.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)HIST-321 Special Topics in Public History
Public history is the practice of history for, and by, audiences outside the classroom. This course 
will focus on a specific theme or topic in public history, chosen by the instructor, announced 
in the subtitle, and developed in the syllabus. The topics of this course will vary, but the course 
number will remain the same, so be sure not to repeat the same topic.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Spring)
HIST-322 Monuments and Memory
Monuments are physical objects that were constructed to help us remember the past, but 
a deeper analysis reveals that the relationship between monuments and the memories they 
embody is complex and changes over time. We will tackle the process of memorializing, the 
monuments that result, and seek greater insight into the arguments these artifacts make about 
the past, the present, and our place in the world.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-323 America's National Parks
The National Parks are some of America's most treasured and spectacular landscapes, but even 
these wild places are the product of historical forces. In this class, we will explore the history of 
America's National Parks, and use these spaces to unpack the relationship between Americans, 
their land, and their history.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-324 Oral History
Oral history collects memories and personal commentaries of historical significance through 
recorded interviews. There are few opportunities for historical research that are more satisfying 
or more challenging than oral history. In this class, we will learn about oral history methods, 
techniques, and ethics. We will read, listen to, and watch some of the finest examples of the 
genre. Then we will go out and add to the world's understanding of its past by conducting oral 
histories of our own. For their final project in this course, students will work in teams to pro -
duce a podcast based on their own interview(s).  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-325 Museums and History
Many more people learn history from museums than from textbooks. What is it that is so spe -
cial about encountering the real thing in a museum? Why are Dorothy's Ruby Slippers the most 
visited artifact in the National Museum of American History? Do history museums themselves 
have an important history? Join us as we investigate the connections between our history, our 
museums, and the material artifacts that tell historical stories.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-326 Digital History
Computers and their networks have fundamentally altered the ways that history is both pro -
duced and consumed. Sources in digital formats simultaneously present opportunities and 
challenges that force us to rethink what is possible in history. Doing history in a digital age 
forces us to engage with the issues and opportunities raised by such as topics as digitization 
and preservation, text mining, interactive maps, new historic methodologies and narrative 
forms, computational programming, and digital storytelling. Digital tools, including blogs, 
wikis, video sharing sites, and many others, help bring history to new audiences in different 
ways. In this course, we will investigate the landscape of digital history and tackle the exciting 
task of understanding and creating history in the digital age.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-330 Deafness and Technology
The deaf community has a long and complicated relationship with technological devices. The 
deaf community, for instance, was quick to embrace the new technology of moving pictures, 
and many deaf actors found work in early Hollywood during the silent film era. Most lost 
their livelihoods when sound was introduced to motion pictures. Deaf people were left out of 
the communication revolution brought about by the telephone for many years, but now the 
deaf community is increasingly a wired community, as texting, tweeting, and vlogging makes 
more communication technologies accessible to deaf users. This course will explore the his -
torical relationship between technology and deafness. It will consider how views of deafness 
frequently shape technology, that is, if deafness is viewed as a pathological illness, technolo -
gies are focused on curing it (e.g., cochlear implants), whereas, if deaf people are viewed as 
members of linguistic and cultural minority, technologies are harnessed to make it easier for 
that minority to interact with the majority culture (e.g, relay systems). This course will con -
sider how deaf people have historically used, created, and adopted technologies to their own 
ends.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)158 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsHIST-333 Diversity in the Deaf Community
Students in this course will be introduced to the historical study of diversity in the Deaf commu -
nity, especially as it relates to issues of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, and sexuality. Students 
will learn to analyze the implications of such diversity in terms of the social perception of deaf 
people, the history of the education of deaf people, and the experience of acculturation for and 
as Deaf people. The course will examine how the process of acculturation has operated, histori -
cally, within the Deaf community. Deaf culture has sought to transcend various differences and 
to bond members of the Deaf community together, in one, larger Deaf identity. But has this 
always been achieved? How has the Deaf community handled issues of diversity in different 
historical moments? Has the history of diversity within the Deaf community been similar to the 
history of diversity within the hearing community? Or have there been distinctively Deaf ways 
of diversity in history? This course will invite students to compare and contrast the history of 
difference and diversity in the deaf and hearing communities, and to explore those historical 
moments of intersection and interaction as well.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-335 Women and the Deaf Community
Deaf history, as a field, has often neglected the story of deaf women. Scholar Arlene B. Kelly has 
recently asked, Where is deaf herstory? This course seeks to correct that gender imbalance in 
deaf history. We will study deaf women's history. This will include a consideration of deaf-blind 
women, as well, as women like Helen Keller were often the most famous deaf women of their era. 
But this course also seeks to look at the role of hearing women in deaf history. Hearing women 
dominated the field of deaf education in the late nineteenth century. They had a tremendous 
impact on the lives of deaf children and the events of deaf educational history. Hearing women 
were also important figures in deaf history as mothers. As mothers of deaf children, hearing 
women were frequently asked to behave as teachers in the home. Their embrace of this role 
often led them to endorse oral education, and oppose the sign language. Hearing mothers in 
this way were pitted against their adult deaf daughters, who frequently went on to learn sign 
language against their mothers' wishes. The historically complex relationship between wom -
en and the deaf community will be explored in this course.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
HIST-340 Rochester Reformers: Changing the World
This course will survey Rochester area social reformers who led a number of critical reform 
movements, identifying problems with the status quo and proposing solutions to those prob -
lems. They worked to establish a new social order and even to perfect society. As an Erie Canal 
boom town and major manufacturing hub, Rochester inspired generations of famous reformers 
who made principled arguments for improving urban life and labor relations, ending slavery 
and securing civil rights for African Americans, and claiming equality for American wom -
en. Students will study the historical impact of celebrated social reformers such as Frederick 
Douglass and Susan B. Anthony as well as less well known figures like religious revivalist 
Charles Finney, urban park reformer Charles Mulford Robinson, and advocate of the social 
gospel Walter Rauschenbusch. The course will also introduce contemporary efforts that have 
attempted to reshape principles of social justice locally and nationally. In the 20th century the 
social reform movement efforts turned to the ethical and social problems of a modernizing 
America, debating solutions to the pressing problems of urbanization, immigration, and envi -
ronmental protection. Students will also work on a community-based research project focusing 
on the history and impact of particular Rochester reformers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-345 Environmental Disasters
This class will survey the history environmental disasters (from floods to oil spills) in mod -
ern American and global society. Students will study several specific disasters (for example, 
Hurricane Katrina, the Great Midwestern Floods of the 1990s, Love Canal, and the Haitian 
Earthquake of 2008) and analyze a series of broader themes that illuminate their meaning, 
including the economic impact of various disasters, the legal and political ramifications of 
modern disasters, and the social and cultural meaning of disasters in various societies.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-350 Terrorism, Intelligence, and War
This course investigates the historical, political, moral, and legal dimensions of terrorism, 
intelligence, and war. It uses a case-study approach with themes that include just war theory, 
terrorism in the colonial and post-colonial worlds, domestic terrorism, and mechanisms of 
intelligence and covert operations.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)HIST-351 The Vietnam War
The Vietnam War continues to loom over American history. In the service of vastly different 
causes, politicians repeatedly invoke it: some define it as a tragic mistake, others as a noble 
cause. Many search for the lessons of Vietnam, a war that cost more than 58,000 American 
lives and as many as three million Vietnamese. In this course, we consider the war experiences 
of both the United States and Vietnam. We begin by highlighting Vietnamese history, culture, 
nationalism, communism, and independence. After analyzing Vietnam as a colony under the 
French, we turn our attention to American involvement beginning in the early years of the 
Cold War and ending with the fall of Saigon. Although we examine military and political his -
tory, the course also emphasizes social and cultural perspectives on a war that tore at the fabric 
of American society and led ultimately to the downfall of two presidents. Last, we look at the 
war’s enduring legacies in the United States and Vietnam today. Readings and assignments for 
the course include government documents, memoirs, fiction, film, and secondary literature 
from both nations.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-355 The Holocaust: Event, History, Memory
In the midst of the Second World War, under the auspices of the National Socialist regime in 
Germany, Germans along with their allies and collaborators murdered roughly six million 
European Jews and countless numbers of other “undesirables, including homosexuals, Slavic 
peoples, and gypsies. This much is incontrovertible, but only in subsequent decades did this 
series of events become known as the Holocaust. In this course we will cover not only the 
historical context and potential causes of the Holocaust—from the long history of European 
anti-Jewish and antisemitic violence to the specifics of National Socialist racial ideology—and 
the events themselves—the persecution, ghettoization and eventually extermination of Jewish 
communities across occupied Europe—but also consider the long afterlife of this historical fact. 
Why (and how) has the Holocaust become a critical episode in both European and global his -
tory? How have the books and films released in the years after 1945 influenced our collective 
consciousness of that period of European history? Why have the most notable location of mass 
murder, the camp at Auschwitz in southern Poland, a memorial in the center of the German 
capital of Berlin, and a museum dedicated to the Holocaust in Washington, DC, become major 
tourist destinations? How have our contemporary understandings of genocide and human 
rights emerged from this series of events? Why are there still thousands of people invested in 
denying that these events ever happened?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
HIST-360 A Global History of Baseball
Baseball has been called America’s game, and the late, great historian Jacques Barzun once 
quipped that in order to understand the soul of America, one first had to understand baseball. 
This may be true about America, and if so, then it is equally true for many other areas of the 
world. Baseball, since the nineteenth century, has been an integral part of not just America’s 
sports culture but also that of countries from Japan to Taiwan to Venezuela to the Dominican 
Republic. This course will examine the origins of baseball from English bat and ball games 
such as Rounders, American missionaries introducing the game to Japan and Korea, baseball 
as a nationalist reaction to Spanish rule in Cuba, and, finally, the global reach of modern base -
ball as seen in such classic institutions as the Little League World Series.  Lecture 3, Credits 
3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-365 Conflict in Modern East Asia
The 20th century has sometimes been called the Pacific Century, which is ironic since this 
period of time has been anything but pacific! The twentieth century saw the rise of four great 
pacific powers; the U.S., Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, and saw the eclipse of several 
others, including the British and French Empires. Furthermore a major front of the Cold War 
was played out on the Asian continent, namely the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as the 
U.S. standoff with Communist China. And of course the Second World War, the greatest con -
centrated period of human destruction, played out at the midpoint of the twentieth century. 
This class will analyze these conflicts both as conflicts in and of themselves, but will also look 
at the backdrop against which these conflicts were played out. Beginning with the subjugation 
of China in the 19th century, our class will examine the many conflicts that defined this region 
through the end of the twentieth century.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
HIST-369 Histories of Christianity
The history of Christianity is not simply the history of the religion of the west. Rather, Christian 
history is a long and complex movement that has profoundly affected Asia, Africa, Europe, and 
the New World. At various times there were several competing ideologies of Christianity, of 
which the west's was only a single example. Christianity also has a long history of interacting 
with other religions, from Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism to Judaism and Islam. This course 
will trace the development of Christianity paying special attention to how the Christian tradi -
tion developed in places such as Africa and Asia. We will, of course, also study Christianity in 
its western forms, but we will make an effort to dive into the rich tradition of this religion in 
all its many forms.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  159
College of Liberal ArtsHIST-370 Global History of Religions
This course will examine the history of the world’s larger religious traditions, including ori -
gins, development in particular societies, and modern forms. This course will explore the 
formal doctrines of various religions, as well as popular cultural manifestations. Topics will 
include the role of religion in state formation, nationalism, and colonialism, as well as how 
religions adapt themselves to local cultures and societies as they spread across regions.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Annual)
HIST-380 International Business History
This course provides an overview on the history of international business since the late 19th 
century. We will examine social change over time in how corporations have handled expan -
sion into foreign markets, why corporations decided to – or not to – expand abroad, how they 
managed their foreign operations, and what contributed to their success or failure abroad. 
To do so, we will look at a variety of factors including how corporations dealt with corporate 
communication, local regulations, transfers of knowledge and technology, and how corporate 
decisions affect communities. We will apply these historical insights to case studies of multi -
national corporations.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-381 Technology in the Modern World
Trains, planes, automobiles, phones and computers – modern technologies like these make 
our daily lives pleasant and convenient. Yet, many people around the globe lack access to these 
technologies. In this course, we will investigate the emergence of industrial manufacturing pro -
cesses in late 18th century Britain that allowed for the development of these technologies. We 
will also examine how new technologies spread to other places in the world, how they shaped 
colonial relations, and what role they play in today’s developing world. In this course, you will 
gain a better understanding of how people around the world have shaped their technologies, 
and how technologies in turn have shaped them.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-383 Technology and Global Relations in the American Century
This class explores the role of technology in US foreign relations during the twentieth centu -
ry, when the United States rose to global power. American engineers, scientists, missionaries, 
executives, and diplomats used technologies to gain strategic advantages, uplift other peoples 
around the globe, or open new market opportunities. We will look at how Americans employed 
a wide range of military, development, and consumer technologies, from torpedoes and air -
planes to dams, schools, automobiles, and computers. Technologies projected superiority and 
serve in civilizing missions; they also often reflected on relations of power, gender, and race. 
Sometimes, technologies moved freely from one place to another, and at other times their 
circulation was impeded. Based on historical sources and assigned readings, the class discus -
sions will investigate how technologies shaped US foreign relations and were in turn shaped 
by them.  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
HIST-390 Medicine and Public Health in American History
This course introduces students to the social and cultural history of medicine by examining dif -
fering concepts of disease, health, and healing throughout American history. Themes include 
the professionalization of medicine, the role of science in medical research and practice, pop -
ular understanding and experience of health and illness, and the role of the state in providing 
medical care. We will explore how science and medicine defined social categories of differ -
ence, including race and gender, and how these categories in turn shaped medical thought and 
practice. The course format combines lectures, discussions, and films and readings include 
historical documents and case studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-402 Special Seminar in History
This upper-level small group seminar will focus on a specific theme or topic in history, chosen 
by the instructor, announced in the subtitle, and developed in the syllabus. All sections of this 
course are writing intensive. The topics of this course will vary, but the course number will 
remain the same, so be sure not to repeat the same topic.  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-421 Hands-on History
Get hands-on experience researching, interpreting, and writing history. The class will tackle a 
common historical theme (announced in the subtitle), then do original historical research on 
a topic of your choice within the overall theme. Our themes do not just rehash old topics with 
little new information to uncover. Instead, we focus on relatively unexplored areas of the past, 
where your research can shed new light on unknown topics. You will learn about history by 
doing it! All majors are welcome.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-431 Theory and Methods of Deaf Geographies
The course is designed to give students theoretical and practical exposure to qualitative social 
science applied research methods in a new area of human geographic and Deaf Studies research: 
Deaf Geographies. Deaf Geographies reside at the intersection of Human Geography and Deaf 
Studies. It considers spatiality, language, citizenship, education, and identity, as well as other 
themes of interest in new ways by viewing these through the eyes of a community who perform 
their cultural and social geographies in the visual. The focus of the course is an instructor-led 
research project. Students will gain a grounding in appropriate methodological theory in order 
to conduct hands-on, primary research that will include proposal writing, data collection, analy -
sis, and dissemination. (Prerequisite:  2nd - 4th year standing.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Summer)HIST-439 Biography as History
This course will look at biography as a form of history. By studying biographies that approach 
their subjects with various formats and methods of presentation, the class will examine how 
the craft of biography shapes our contemporary understanding of the historical past. Among 
the questions to be examined in this course are: how does biography reveal the historical cir -
cumstances of the subject’s life to give readers a broader understanding of the historical context 
of that life? How effectively can contemporary readers explore the past through the prism of 
one person’s life? Can the history of an era be effectively told through an examination of one 
person’s life? What are the benefits of the biographical approach to history? What are the draw -
backs? What are the benefits of biography as a form of public history? That is, when people can 
get their history through the Biography Channel, how important is it for public historians to 
grapple with the impact of biography as a form with a unique grip on the public imagination?

tors have drawn on this heritage to depict historical experiences.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-462 East-West Encounters
The Age of Discovery, beginning in the 15th century and culminating with the advent of 
European imperialism, is one of the most fascinating, as well as problematic, periods in the 
history of both Asia and Europe. Too often historians frame the interaction between Asia and 
Europe in uniquely European terms and present Asia as a passive partner in this process of 
discovery. In fact, this period presents us with a number of complex issues such as national 
identity, the nature of European expansion, and the Asian response to European journeys 
to the East. This course will undertake to re-examine the age of discovery not only from a 
European point of view, but also from an Asian standpoint. In the process, we will see how 
many of the issues that we are facing in the region are products of a long and complex relation -
ship between Europe and Asia. Students will also examine the issues that have arisen between 
the east and the west in the twentieth century and that continue into our own time.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
HIST-465 Samurai in Word and Image
One of the most enduring images of premodern Japan in the samurai, replete with sword and 
armor. This course will seek to examine the role of the samurai in Japanese history, examining 
popular perceptions in Japanese film, woodblock prints, and texts. We will also use a variety 
of secondary sources to critically examine some of the portrayals of the samurai and how they 
stand up to historical reality. Students will be encouraged to participate in extensive discus -
sions as we deal with a great variety of media and try to arrive at an image of the samurai that 
is historically accurate. And finally, we will examine issues such as feudalism and the war -
rior code and how those historical concepts relate to the west at about the same time period.

HIST-470 Science, Tech, and European Imperialism: 1800-1965
Between 1800 and 1945, Western nations dominated approximately three-quarters of the 
earth’s surface through imperialism. This course examines how industrialization, technologi -
cal developments, and the emergence of the modern sciences facilitated Europe’s conquest and 
colonization of vast territories overseas. The course opens with a brief overview of the role of 
biology and science in shaping early imperial encounters (the Columbian Exchange). Students 
will then consider how 19th-century botany, zoology, acclimatization, cartography, geogra -
phy, and anthropology became imperial sciences that facilitated formal conquest by producing 
knowledge about distant cultures, races, and environments. The Industrial Revolution produced 
new technological tools--steamboats, railroads, and weapons--that facilitated the Scramble for 
territory in the late 19th century. The course will consider how these inventions shaped pat -
terns of conquest and colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Throughout the 
course, students will interrogate how Europeans’ faith in the superiority of Western technology, 
scientific knowledge, and medicine shaped the evolution of the European civilizing mission-- 
the cultural and political logic that defined interactions between Europeans and non-Western 
populations. At the same time, they will evaluate how Africans and Asians experienced living 
under colonial rule, and in some cases, how they deployed Western technology as weapons of 
resistance to imperialism.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
HIST-480 Global Information Age
The internet and cell phones seem to have turned us into world citizens of cyberspace. 
Programmers in Bangalore or Chennai now write software for U.S. companies, and doctors 
in India or Australia interpret the Cat-Scan or MRI images of US patients overnight. As best -
selling author Thomas Friedman argues, the world is flat, that is competition for intellectual 
work is now global. Others have suggested that information technologies have led to glob -
al homogenization, with people around the world reading the same news, listening to the 
same music, and purchasing the same products. In this class, we will investigate the history 
of information and communication technologies to cast new light on these claims about our 
present-day technologies. This class is a small seminar which includes a research project.

ITDL-150 Interdisciplinary Explorations of Human Problems
Climate change, racism, lack of accessibility, poverty, moral disagreement, civil conflict, access 
to water, and piracy are all examples of enduring human problems. This shell course allows 
students to explore a single “human problem” across disciplines, bringing together knowl -
edge from liberal arts, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, health, arts and design. 
Students will read transformative texts across a variety of disciplines and apply those texts to 
a single modern “human” problem in this project-based course. Students will pay particular 
attention to the social and ethical components within the texts, the problem, its causes, and 
proposed solutions. The possible problems are intentionally broad and reach across multiple 
disciplines. Students will be expected to apply their understanding to practice-based projects 
in interdisciplinary groups and then present their findings, demonstrating both the breadth 
and depth of their understanding, as well as their creativity. Throughout the semester and in 
each assignment, students will explore the ethical and social implications of the course topic, 
exploring the ways different disciplinary approaches assess and think about ethical and social 
problems and their possible solutions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
ITDL-151H Explorations of Place and Space
This honors seminar is a foundational course that examines how our social worlds are linked 
to our natural and built worlds. The corresponding emphasis on inquiry, analysis, and inter -
pretation facilitates student-engaged learning. In exploring pertinent place and space related 
issues/topics through an experiential, active, and site-specific curricular focused learning, vari -
ous aspects of the human condition are discovered. The theme or topic of this honors seminar,

ITDL-205 Grand Challenges:  Clean Water
We face grand challenges in the 21st century that will test our collective intelligence and 
resourcefulness — global change, new diseases, the need for access to clean water, technolog -
ical developments that are changing us and our relation to the world. We have the opportunity 
to transform our future through innovation and leadership, but we need to improve our criti -
cal thinking, innovate towards possible solutions, and work across disciplines to meet these 
common challenges. This course is therefore open to all students with the curiosity, imagina -
tion, and commitment to meet such challenges. We need engineers, scientists, public policy 
specialists, and humanists — individuals from every field of study and endeavor –– to con -
tribute to global efforts to meet these challenges. One of the most important challenges of our 
time — and one identified by the National Academy of Engineers as among fourteen Grand 
Challenges— is that of providing access to clean water to people across the globe. This course 
focuses on this grand challenge though interdisciplinary links between the liberal arts and engi -
neering. Students will work in teams to analyze the scope of the clean water problem, examine 
real case studies, trouble shoot observed problems, and propose alternative solutions. Given 
the social and cultural contexts within which the need for clean water access arises, this course 
encourages students to think holistically about sustainable solutions rather than narrowly about 
the technical quick fix. (Prerequisites: This class is restricted to students with 1st or 2nd year 
standing.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)

International and Global Studies
INGS-101 Global Studies
Within the past three decades, planetary computerization, burgeoning media industries, and 
other global processes have significantly altered the ways in which we experience our local and 
global worlds. Global reconfigurations of time and space change our consciousness, sense of 
self and others, and the material realities in which we live and work. This course provides the 
conceptual tools to assess emerging global processes, interactions and flows of people, ideas 
and things that challenge historical patterns of international studies and relations. The course 
will introduce you to international and global processes in areas such as global cultural econ -
omies, global cities, new forms of democracy and civil society, global religions, sexualities, 
health, and environments, increased competition for resources, political conflict, war and ter -
rorism. Beyond understanding the causes and consequences of global change, this course will 
introduce you to ethical dilemmas in global justice movements, and in transferring ideas and 
technologies in new global contexts.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
INGS-201 Histories of Globalization
Globalization is a human process, influenced by contemporary and historical issues that are 
routinely conceived of as affecting or pertaining to the world’s population in its entirety, such 
as human rights, humanitarianism, environmental degradation, trade, and military power. We 
use the world and its population as the unit of analysis with an emphasis is placed on issues that 
appear to be in tension with the role of the nation-state and nationality, and highlight world and 
global citizenship. We explore critiques of the conceptualization of globality and worldliness as 
a factor in determining social, cultural, and historical change.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)INGS-270 Cuisine, Culture and Power
Physically, culturally, and socially, humans live through food and drink. Spanning the globe, as 
nearly limitless omnivores, humans have developed myriad ways of collecting and cultivating 
food and taking advantage of local environments. We also put food to work for us socially by 
creating cuisine. Through cuisine, we forge and nourish relationships, commune with deities, 
and through luxury choices, demonstrate our "taste" and lay claim to elite status. Through the 
cultural practices of production and consumption of food and drink, we wield power. Food 
and drink consumption patterns have sustained slavery, poverty, malnutrition, and illegal 
immigration, and have laid waste to the environment. In this class, we explore physical, cul -
tural, social, political, and economic dimensions of food and become more aware of how the 
private, intimate act of a bite connects us to the rest of humanity.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)

syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) and to principles and methods of linguistics through dis -
cussion and the analysis of a wide range of linguistic data based on current linguistic models. 
English will often serve as the reference language, but we will discuss a wide variety of lan -
guages, including sign languages, to illustrate core concepts in linguistics. The course will have 
relevance to other disciplines in the liberal arts and sciences as well as technical fields. Students 
will critically study human languages through discussions of the origins of languages, how lan -
guages are acquired, their organization in the brain, and languages' socio-cultural roles. Some 
other topics that will be introduced are: language endangerment, language and computers, and 
artificially constructed languages in the film or fiction industry.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)

In this course, students will learn about linguistic methods for characterizing meaning con -
sidering words, sentences, conversation, and language in situational contexts. The class will 
examine these topics in English and across languages and cultures, studying different linguis -
tic frameworks for describing meaning, including debates among them. We will explore the 
link between verbal and non-verbal semantics, and apply systematic meaning description and 
analysis to literary production, advertising, clinical interactions, entertainment, and digital 
media discourse.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
LING-370 Evolving English Language
What makes the English language so difficult? Where do our words come from? Why does 
Old English look like a foreign language? This course surveys the development of the English 
language from its beginning to the present to answer such questions as these. Designed for 
anyone who is curious about the history and periods of the English language or the nature of 
language change. You will examine connections among English speech communities world-
wide and their English varieties.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)

Museum Studies
MUSE-220 Introduction to Museums
This course examines the history, theory, and practice of museums by situating them as social 
institutions emerging within their broader historical and cultural contexts, from their origins 
in the mouseion of the classical era and Renaissance cabinets of curiosities to the modern 
era’s World’s Fairs and museums of today. The evolution and range of museum functions are 
addressed. Building on these foundations, the following types of museums and institutions 
are explored: art and design, natural history, anthropology, science, and history museums, as 
well as historic houses and sites, botanical gardens, and zoos. In studying the histories and 
functions of museums through the lenses of social institutions, the course highlights the evo -
lution of museums institutionally, ideologically, and experientially. The course considers the 
operations of museums, governance, and the professional ethics and legal constraints that 
affect museum professionals; examines museums and their practices through the perspectives 
of colonialism and de-colonialization, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, anti-racism, and 
community; and includes field trips to local institutions and on-campus site visits throughout 
the semester.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
MUSE-221 Introduction to Public History
Public history is using the research-based methods and techniques of historians to conduct 
historical work in the public sphere. If you've gone to a museum, conducted an oral history, 
researched your old house, or learned from an interpreter at a park or historic site, you've seen 
public history in action. This course will introduce students to the wide variety of careers in 
public history, and will examine the challenges and opportunities that come with doing his -
tory in, with, and for the public.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-223 Historic Photographic Processes
This is a studio based class in which student recreate a number of different nineteenth century 
photographic processes. Students will explore the history of photographic technology through 
use of primary sources and hands on projects. The chemistry and deterioration of the mate -
rials will be reviewed through the use of primary texts, projects, and discussion.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-224 History and Theory of Exhibitions
Exhibitions are organized around a creative curatorial premise, a statement that articulates an 
idea allowing for the selection of work included in an exhibition. This course begins with an 
overview of exhibition history, starting with the transformation of the Louvre into the first pub -
lic art museum following the French Revolution, where art history, a discipline developed in the 
19th century, was enlisted to organize exhibitions. The class analyzes how art and exhibitions 
represent the cultural contexts in which they are created. The course examines the proliferation 
of types of exhibitions that accompanies modernism, up to the present, paying close attention 
to the curatorial premise animating the exhibitions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-225 Museums and the Digital Age
The digital revolution has profoundly influenced how we think about the world around us. 
Information once available only to experts is now accessible digitally to a much broader audi -
ence. Museums, archives, and libraries have adapted to this democratization of knowledge 
and decentralization of access in myriad ways. As visitors to museums—whether online or 
onsite—each of us is part of the creation, consumption, and reception of digital information. 
What does this mean for museums and for us as audiences and consumers of such information? 
How has the combination of digital technology and social media increased visitors’ abilities 
for interaction with cultural institutions, their collections, and other visitors? This course will 
examine the history and evolution of museum practices as they adapt to new technologies and 
rethink traditional museum practices. The course has no pre-requisite and is open to students 
of all majors.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  163

Cultural heritage is a fluid term that applies broadly to the creation, protection, and preserva -
tion of material objects and intangible practices for future generations. This course examines 
the concepts associated with tangible, intangible, and natural cultural heritage with a global 
outlook. Through readings, discussion, and projects, the course explores the various forms that 
cultural heritage takes and frames them in terms of digital creation, consumption, and preser -
vation. Course content may be site-specific.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-241 Topics in Museum Studies: Art, Design, and Exhibition Projects
This variable topic course examines one or more methods, concepts, or theories of museum 
studies and its intersection with art, craft, and design. Whether focusing on the content of 
collections (i.e., fine art, craft, design, or other disciplines) or the conceptual development 
of displays informed by a curatorial premise informed by methods, concepts, and theories of 
museum studies, the course frames art and design collections in relation to exhibition proj -
ects. The course centers themes, figures, movements, or issues associated with artistic practice, 
and/or the historical, cultural, and theoretical questions of exhibitions and display. The topic 
for the course is chosen by the instructor, announced in the course subtitle, and developed 
in the syllabus, particularly through the readings and deliverables. The course can be taken 
multiple times provided that the topic is different. The artistic framing for these topics may 
center one or both of the following areas of inquiry: art, craft, and design as the subject of the 
course (i.e., focusing on the collections held by RIT at the Dyer Arts Center, Cary Graphic Art 
Collection, and Vignelli Center for Design Studies) and/or creative approaches to deliverables, 
from ideation to presentation in one of the gallery spaces at RIT, or in another exhibition space 
(including online).  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
MUSE-244 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Society
This variable topic course examines one or more methods, concepts, or theories of museum 
studies as a framing for understanding of the diversity of human cultures today and over time. 
Whether focusing on the content of collections (i.e., cultural heritage, undocumented migra -
tion, wrongful imprisonment, de-colonization) or the conceptual development of displays 
informed by a curatorial premise informed by methods, concepts, and theories of museum 
studies, the course examines topics of social relevance in relation to exhibition projects. The 
course centers themes, figures, movements, or issues of contemporary society, and/or the his -
torical, cultural, and theoretical questions of exhibitions and display. The topic for the course

particularly through the readings and deliverables. The course can be taken multiple times 
provided that the topic is different.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-249 Topics in Archives, Museums, and Community Collections
Topics courses offer the opportunity to build knowledge specific to events, issues, and oppor -
tunities unique to archives, museums, and collecting institutions. Topics and methods vary 
from term to term, though each offering features an introduction to a concept, methodolo -
gy, institution, or other subfield of study within museum studies or public history. Students 
develop theoretical and experiential knowledge of the topic under investigation while fostering 
opportunities to respond to recent events or to partner with local organizations and institutions. 
Students also create deliverables appropriate to the experience. The topic will be announced 
prior to the course offering. The course may be repeated for credit since topics will normally 
vary from semester to semester.  Lecture, Credits 1 - 3 (Fall or Spring)
MUSE-340 Introduction to Archival Studies
This course introduces students to the role of archives in the construction of a society’s cultural 
heritage and historical identity. Archives are repositories of a culture’s original documents, 
both paper and electronic, and they function as a site for the construction, preservation, and 
dissemination of historical memory, as a source for social responsibility, and as a tool for the 
understanding of the cultural, social, and political forces that influence events. The course will 
examine the history of archives, the theory and practice that guide the work of archivists, and 
examine the basic components of an archival program: including acquisition and appraisal, 
arrangement and description, preservation and legal and ethical issues related to access to 
archival records. The class will also cover the transformation of the profession in the digital age, 
including digital preservation, the work of archival appraisal and collection building in an age of 
digital proliferation, and archival collection management systems.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
MUSE-341 Museum Education and Interpretation
This course introduces students to the educational mission of the museum and to the museum’s 
role in educating citizens for participation in a democratic, pluralistic society. As sites of infor -
mal learning, museums have an educational impact on our lives beyond our formal schooling. 
The course focuses on a wide range of educational activities within museums that address visi -
tors of all ages as individuals and as members of a democratic society, and helps to foster in 
them a sense of community, civic responsibility, tolerance for multiple viewpoints, and lifelong 
love of learning. The course examines the institutional shift from a fixed, scholarly approach 
to exhibiting collections to one that embraces the concept of interpretation, where visitors are 
encouraged to engage in a variety of experiences, make their own connections with objects 
and other visitors, and ultimately construct their own meanings.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)MUSE-354 Exhibition Design
This course examines the history and practice of exhibition design. It reviews the history of 
exhibitions within the development of museum-like institutions. In this course the following 
aspects of exhibition design are considered: curatorial premise or theme, exhibition develop -
ment timeline, exhibition site, contracts and contractual obligations, budgets and fundraising, 
publicity material, didactic material, and exhibition design. The course includes field trips to 
local institutions and collections throughout the term.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
MUSE-355 Fundraising, Grant Writing, and Marketing for Nonprofit Institutions
This course examines the growing autonomy of collecting institutions as they are cut off from 
various forms of governmental sponsorship and public subsidy and their subsequent needs 
for raising money from outside, non-traditional sources. The course looks at issues of needs 
assessment, budgeting, and strategic planning. It focuses on the design and implementation 
of effective fundraising campaigns, as well as on the organization and writing of successful 
grant proposals. It also considers the importance of marketing to overall institutional success.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
MUSE-357 Collections Management
This course presents an overview of the administration and management of museums and their 
collections. The course examines the governance structure of museums, focusing on person -
nel responsible for their administration, curation and education, and operations, as well as on 
the mission statement and policies they determine. The course also details the management 
of collections, including the development of a collections policy, management of that policy, 
documentation and record keeping, acquisitions, and the creation/management of exhibitions. 
Finally, the course considers collections care or preventive conservation, looking at both the 
facility and collections. Throughout the term, legal and ethical issues pertaining to museums 
and their collections will be emphasized. (Prerequisites: MUSE-220 or 0533-421 or equivalent 
course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-358 Legal and Ethical Issues for Collecting Institutions
This course presents an overview of the legal and ethical issues that govern the institutions 
and personnel involved in collecting cultural resources. Collecting institutions are governed 
by national, state, and local laws that define how facilities and collections are used and this 
course will consider them, as well as the larger social and historical context out of which they 
developed. The course will consider the evolution of the museum as a public institution and 
how the legal system increasingly defined minimum standards for maintaining collections, 
the facilities in which they are housed, and guaranteeing public access; in addition legal stan -
dards for the collection will be studied, including definitions of ownership, what this means in 
terms of intellectual property rights, copyright, reproduction (traditional and electronic), and 
deaccessioning/disposal. These will be studied within the context of the society within which 
the institution functions. The course will also study the development of national and inter -
national ethical standards and will examine the codes of behavior that govern the personal 
and professional conduct of museum professionals and the practices that comprise conflicts 
of interest. Ethical standards for collecting institutions will also be considered, particularly 
those that address the responsibilities to a collection, the ethics of acquisition, the question of 
illicit or stolen material, the issues of human remains and objects of sacred significance, and 
repatriation. Attention will be paid to the changes in society that made these issues critical for 
collecting institutions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-359 Digital and Critical Curation
This course introduces students to Cultural Informatics, the interdisciplinary field that 
examines the intersections of information technologies, information science, and cultural 
information centered in museums, libraries, and archives. Among the topics to be examined 
are: how information technologies are used in museums, libraries, and archives; how modern 
information systems have shaped the museum environment; the nature of convergence; the 
development of digital collections, digital curation, and online exhibitions; and the role and 
status of the information professional in the museum and cultural organizations. The course 
is designed around projects, case studies, and readings so that students gain hands-on experi -
ence working with information. The course has no prerequisite and is open to students of all 
majors.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
MUSE-360 Visitor Engagement and Museum Technologies
All of us, as museum visitors, have the capacity to engage with collections and to create mean -
ings as a result of such interaction. This course considers the history and theory of visitor 
engagement at museums, galleries, and sites of cultural heritage tourism; examines the import 
of technology into this history; and articulates the role of visitors as participants who curate their 
own experiences. Two key questions will be addressed in this course: 1) How does technology 
provide a platform for contribution, collaboration, co-creation, and co-opting of experiences 
among all visitors? and 2) Can technology mediate the best possible experience for visitors? The 
course has no prerequisite and is open to students of all majors.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)164 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsMUSE-361 Tablet to Tablet: A History of Books
From ancient clay and wax tablets, to scrolls and medieval manuscripts, to printed books and 
iPads, this class examines the history of books from 2300 BCE to the present. Students study 
books not only as vehicles for texts, but also as physical artifacts that carry with them important 
evidence of the cultures that produced and read them. Using the Cary Graphic Arts Collection 
as their research laboratory, students investigate the evolution of books through hands-on 
interaction with artifacts both ancient and modern, while also pondering what forms future 
books might take.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
MUSE-388 Gender and Contemporary Art
This course traces the historical development of women’s activism in the art world from the 
1970s to the present. We will interpret how this art activism, which artists and scholars alike 
have referred to as the feminist art movement, has examined how gender informs the ways art 
is made, viewed, conceptualized in history and theory, and exhibited in museums and visual 
culture, in a range of cultural contexts. We will also analyze how current artists, critics, and 
curators continue to build on this history, in particular how they use the concept of gender 
intersectionally to develop a variety of new creative practices, theories, modes of exhibition 
and social engagement.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)

tunity to observe and participate in the theatre design process from conception to execution, 
while learning basic stagecraft skills involved in professional theatre production via an intern -
ship at a local theatre. Students will work directly with professional directors, designers and 
stage technicians on the production of a play from design concept to performance. The experi -
ence will allow active engagement in collaborative processes and methods commonly employed 
to create theatre productions. Depending upon the interests and abilities of the student, and the 
needs of the specific production, students may be assigned to a specific area of design stagecraft 
(i.e. Costumes or Scenic), or learn and engage in a more general capacity. The learning objec -
tives of this apprenticeship are to give students an understanding of the goals and methods of 
design and stagecraft as critical elements in translating a play text into a fully realized artis -
tically unified theatre expression. Students will have bi-weekly meetings with the instructor.

PRFL-352 Russian Music and National Identity
Russia’s history contains a complex blend of indigenous artistic expression and artistic influ -
ences from beyond its borders. Given its large land mass and geographical position spanning 
Europe and Asia, Russian monarchs struggled with understanding who the Russian people 
were, but also how to best navigate the cultural and economic commonalities and differences 
among their neighbors, with whom they desired relationships. This course explores the many 
ways music in Russia reflected the cultural influences apropos to its complex history and nation -
al identity in the world. The focus will be on the political, social, and artistic aspects of Russian 
music nationalism emerging in the 19th century and continuing into the 20th-century Soviet 
Era, but will include a review of the cultural and historical background from the 9th through 
the 18th centuries which led to Russia’s own, unique musical and artistic language. This is a

College of Liberal ArtsPhilosophy
PHIL-101 Introduction to Philosophy
Philosophy is about the rigorous discussion of big questions, and sometimes small precise ques -
tions, that do not have obvious answers. This class is an introduction to philosophical thinking 
where we learn how to think and talk critically about some of these challenging questions. 
Such as: Is there a single truth or is truth relative to different people and perspectives? Do we 
have free will and, if so, how? Do we ever really know anything? What gives life meaning? Is 
morality objective or subjective, discovered or created? We’ll use historical and contemporary 
sources to clarify questions like these, to understand the stakes, to discuss possible responses, 
and to arrive at a more coherent, more philosophically informed, set of answers.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
PHIL-102 Introduction to Moral Issues
This course examines ethical questions that arise in the course of day-to-day individual and 
social life. Some consideration will be given to ethical theory and its application to such ques -
tions, but emphasis will be on basic moral questions and practical issues. Examples of typical 
issues to be examined are: What are the grounds for moral obligations like keeping promises 
or obeying the law? How do we reason about what to do? Examples of typical moral issues that 
may be introduced are capital punishment, euthanasia, abortion, corporate responsibility, the 
treatment of animals, and so forth.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
PHIL-103 Critical Thinking
The purpose of this course is to improve everyday reasoning skills. Critical thinking means 
evaluating the reasons for our actions and beliefs. Ideally, we think our actions are rational, not 
arbitrary. But one does not have to look far to discover disagreement and apparent irrational -
ity. What accounts for this? This course investigates how to argue effectively, how to evaluate 
evidence and reasons, and how to marshal good evidence and reasons in order to arrive at reli -
able knowledge and justified action. It covers common mistakes that people make in causal, 
statistical, moral, and everyday reasoning, and it teaches how and when it pays to be skeptical, 
reflective, and critical.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
PHIL-201 Ancient Philosophy
This course examines the origin and development of Western philosophy in ancient Greece 
from Thales in the 6th century down to at least the 4th century B.C.E., concentrating on the 
central ideas of the pre-Socratics, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Some attention 
might also be given to the Hellenistic philosophers (Epicureans, Stoics, and Sceptics). This was 
a period of remarkable intellectual creativity in philosophy, mathematics, medicine, rhetorical 
theory, ethics, aesthetics and cosmology. Questions to be considered in this course will include: 
What are the nature and limits of knowledge? Is knowledge even possible? What is the nature 
of language? How reliable is perception? What is the true nature of reality? What is the origin 
and nature of the material world? Is moral knowledge possible? What is the nature of happi -
ness, and what sort of life would make people happy?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-202 Foundations of Moral Philosophy
This course is a survey of foundational, and normative, approaches to moral philosophy and 
their motivating moral questions. Topics will include virtue ethics, deontology, consequential -
ism, and other approaches. Some of the questions to be examined are: How is human nature 
related to morality? What are the grounds for moral obligations? Is there an ultimate moral 
principle? How do we reason about what to do? Can reason determine how we ought to live? 
What are moral judgments? Are there universal goods? What constitutes a morally worthwhile 
life? Can morality itself be challenged?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-203 Modern Philosophy
This course examines the history of modern philosophy, from Descartes through Kant. It con -
centrates on the development of modern thought, examining the concepts of mind, body, and 
causation among others. This period marked the beginning of modern science, with a rich fer -
ment of ideas, and the philosophy of the period is essential to understanding modern science 
as well as contemporary problems about consciousness, mind/body interaction, causation, and 
so on. Questions to be considered in this course include the following: What can we know? 
How do we come to know what we can know? What is the scope and what are the limits of our 
knowledge? What is the nature of reality? Do we have access to reality? How is causal interac -
tion possible, if at all? Does God exist, and if so, how do we know and what relation does God 
have to the world?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
PHIL-205 Symbolic Logic
An introduction to symbolic, or formal, deductive logic and techniques, such as truth tables,

ticular consequences of ethical considerations within the student's own profession and the 
professions of others with whom the student must live and work.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-307 Philosophy of Technology
Technology is a ubiquitous and defining force in our world. This course investigates how our 
conceptions of technology have emerged within philosophy, as well as the role technology 
plays in shaping how we live and how we reflect upon questions of meaning and value in life. 
Technological modes of understanding, organizing and transforming the world shape our rela -
tionships with others, with ourselves and with nature at fundamental levels. We will explore 
how these modes have emerged and why they emerged so predominantly within a Western 
social and intellectual context.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-308 Environmental Philosophy
Environmental philosophy examines the ethical, metaphysical, and social justice questions 
surrounding human interactions with nature and the management of natural resources. This

to environmental issues such as endangered species, climate change, wilderness preservation, 
sustainability, and environmental justice.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-309 Feminist Theory
This course examines the main currents in contemporary feminist thought. Feminist theory 
explores the nature and effects of categories of sex and gender upon our ways of living, thinking 
and doing, while also challenging how gendered assumptions might shape our conceptions of 
identity and inquiry more generally. Different conceptions of sex and gender will be discussed, 
and the course will investigate how these concepts affect our lives in both concrete and symbolic 
ways. Special attention will be paid to how gendered assumptions color our understanding of 
knowledge production, experiences of embodiment and emotion, public and private activities, 
and the nature of ethical decision making.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-310 Theories of Knowledge
Epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, examines how we come to know what we know. This

and self-realization, causality, right action, and enlightenment. Comparisons may also be made 
with Western philosophers, both contemporary and classical.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  167
College of Liberal ArtsPHIL-312 American Philosophy
This course examines the contributions of American philosophers from the colonial era to the 
present day. From the New England Transcendentalists of the 19th century, to the Pragmatism 
and Neo-Pragmatism of the 20th and 21st, American philosophy has responded to the demands 
of a pluralistic, ever-changing society. Because American philosophy is a reflection of American 
culture, it has also offered a unique perspective on perennial philosophical problems in ways 
that have differed sharply from dominant forms of European philosophy. Authors may include 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, C.S. 
Peirce, Jane Addams, William James, John Dewey, Richard Rorty, and Cornel West.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall)

Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-314 Philosophy of Vision and Imaging
This course examines how philosophers and others have understood the nature and primacy of 
sight. It explores how technologies of seeing and imaging have influenced theories of sight and 
our most dominant and authoritative practices of seeing and representing in the humanities 
and the arts, as well as in the natural and social sciences. The course will focus on the impact 
these theories and practices of seeing and representing both analogue and digital have on the 
nature of knowing, as well as on how they shape and mediate our experiences of personal and 
social identity and agency more generally.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
PHIL-315 Responsible Knowing
What we do is connected to what we know. Acting well depends on appropriate evaluation 
of perception, logic, and evidence, and acting on our beliefs commits us to various ethical 
outcomes. In addition, understanding how our minds work and how we produce knowledge 
in teams and institutions can improve the reliability of what we know and can assist us in 
achieving ethical goals. This course develops advanced critical thinking skills and investigates 
how knowledge claims and value claims interact in order to shed light on the conditions that 
make responsible knowing possible. We will study how we produce responsible knowledge 
individually and collectively: from how we make ethically rational choices in our own lives to 
how society directs research priorities in science and technology. Topics may include: ratio -
nal decision-making, cognitive bias, moral psychology, social epistemology, epistemic, and 
ethical relativism, risk and uncertainty, research integrity, and values in science.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
PHIL-316 Bioethics and Society

familiar with the concepts and principles of bioethics while engaging with case studies and relat -
ed media. Part of the philosophy immersion, the ethics immersion, the global justice immersion, 
the philosophy minor, the ethics minor, and the philosophy major. May also be taken to fulfill 
the ethical perspective, the global perspective, or as an elective.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
PHIL-317 Renaissance Philosophy
This course provides an overview of the Renaissance (c. 1350-1650), one of the most important 
cultural revolutions of Western civilization affecting nearly all aspects of European life—the 
arts, the relation with the natural world, and the attitude toward religion, the past, and poli -
tics. The “Renaissance person” came to denote a universal individual whose knowledge spaces 
over the entire realm of experience. The overarching theme of the Renaissance – human -
ism – prefigures contemporary theories of posthumanism, transhumanism, and the critique 
of anthropocentrism in general. Thinkers considered in this course include Petrarca, Valla, 
Pompanazzi, Cusanus, Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Machiavelli, Erasmus, Luther, Suárez, 
More, Bruno, Telesio, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Montaigne, and Bacon.  Lecture 3, Credits

and contemporary thinkers on various kinds of love, including some controversial versions of 
it; we will consider the relation of love in its various forms to desire, emotions, physical inti -
macy, seduction, sex, sexuality, sexual orientation, and the construction of personal identity; 
and we will analyze how the various forms of love affect and are affected by gender norms, 
roles, and images.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)PHIL-401 Great Thinkers

government. A final topic is policy-making, including revenues and expenditures, which again 
illustrate the interrelationship of the three levels.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)POLS-280 Artificial Intelligence and the Political Good
This course examines the political promises and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) through 
the consideration of the technological trajectories and possible scenarios of advanced AI. 
Possible discussion topics may include: The compatibility of AI with the political principles of 
liberty, equality, and the pursuit of happiness to understanding what an AI arms race between 
countries might entail. Domestically, will the prospect of greater job automation produce mass 
unemployment with severe consequences? Globally, will the weaponization of AI make going 
to war easier? Questions like these are inherently political and the movement toward greater 
AI capabilities raises the more general question of whether humanity will be able to regulate, 
both domestically and globally, a technology that promises to surpass all technology that has 
gone before it. This course will seek to anticipate and prepare for the risks that advanced AI 
poses to domestic and global politics. The goal will be to think about how advanced AI can be 
prudentially oriented toward beneficial practices for the sake of the political good.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
POLS-285 Environmental Ethics and Political Ecology
This course examines environmental issues through a variety of political and ethical perspec -
tives. The goal of the course is to understand how the meaning of political and ethical concepts 
(e.g., citizenship, justice, responsibility, security, sovereignty) have been broadened or rein -
terpreted in light of the ascendancy of environmentalism. For instance, the course will cover 
questions concerning whether environmentalism has encouraged a more precautionary sort of 
politics, especially in regard to agricultural biotechnology, along with how it has transformed 
the traditional military definition of security to include new notions such as climate or food 
security. To address these questions and issues, the course fosters an appreciation of the ethical 
reasoning of the interdisciplinary field known as political ecology. An emphasis on the ethical 
reasoning of political ecology will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of environ -
mental issues through unraveling the political forces at work in environmental change at both 
the global and local levels.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
POLS-290 Politics and the Life Sciences
This course examines the intersection between politics and the life sciences. The course will 
examine the biological approach to human behavior, paying special attention to the implica -
tions of biological explanations of behavior for political systems. Topics to be covered may 
include the biological approach to morality, law, and international conflict, as well as the politi -

POLS-295 Cyberpolitics
Innovations in digital communication technologies have the potential to affect many aspects 
of politics and government. Beyond specific elements such as elections and delivery of gov -
ernment services, these developments have the potential to expand and redefine the nature of 
political participation and civic engagement, and to alter the structure of political power. This 
course examines the potential and promise of digital democracy, and attempts to separate hype 
from reality.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
POLS-300 Rhetoric and Political Deliberation
Often political deliberation requires reasoning about indeterminate subjects of public import, 
which do not permit us to arrive at incontestable conclusions. Even where there is compelling 
evidence the conclusions of political deliberation usually require rhetorical assistance. Rhetoric 
reflects an appreciation that the simple truth and scientific facts do not suffice in all circum -
stances, that citizens sometimes have to be persuaded and led through persuasive speeches to 
reach reasonable decisions in public life. This course examines the role of rhetoric in politi -
cal deliberation through a consideration of some of the most politically important speeches in 
American and international politics. The course will also consider the political use of rhetori -
cal devices as well as the differences between deliberative, epideictic and forensic rhetoric. As 
a writing intensive course, students will practice the writing conventions associated with the 
discipline and their skills in editing, revising, and reviewing their writing and the writing of 
their peers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)

As part of this course, students will learn about the types of research methods and theoretical 
models required for investigating the impact of culture on our psychology.Cultural psychol -
ogists study a number of key research questions including but not limited to how and why 
cultural groups differ, how cultural groups are similar, the dynamic interaction between culture 
and individual differences or personality, and the multiple ways in which culture influences 
cognition and behavior. Critically, cultural psychology emphasizes the value and importance 
of appreciating diversity and multiculturalism. As one example, cultural psychology incorpo -
rates intersectionality by focusing on the combined effect of multiple identities, such as gender 
and cultural heritage in shaping our psychology. This course will provide an in-depth focus on 
diversity, multiculturalism, and the value of appreciating the global landscape in which we live.

In this class, we will look at policies that address social inequity, with a particular focus on 
socially disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. Special emphasis will be placed on under -
standing different dimensions of social equity in social policy debates at the federal, state, and 
local levels. We will utilize common ethical frameworks, such as justice, equality, fairness, and 
care, alongside other analysis tools, to examine these policies.Topics vary from year to year or 
term. Students may repeat the course, but may not repeat the topic. This course can be taken 
as part of the Public Policy minor and immersion or may be taken as an elective.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
PUBL-363 Cyber Security Policy and Law
Why are we still so bad at protecting computer systems? Is it because we don’t have good 
enough technology? Or because we lack sufficient economic incentives to implement that 
technology? Or because we implement technologies but then fail to use them correctly? Or 
because the laws governing computer security are so outdated? Or because our legal frame -
works are ill-equipped to deal with an international threat landscape? All these reasons—and 
others— have been offered to explain why we seem to see more and more large-scale cyber -
security incidents and show no signs of getting better at preventing them. This course will 
examine the non-technical dimensions of this problem—the laws and other policy measures 
that govern computer security threats and incidents. We will focus primarily on U.S. policy 
but will also discuss relevant policies in the E.U. and China, as well as international tensions 
and norms. The central themes of the course will be the ways in which technical challenges in 
security can be influenced by the social, political, economic, and legal landscapes, and what it 
means to protect against cybersecurity threats not just by writing better code but also by writ -
ing better policies and laws.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)

degree students. In the course, students work to identify and analyze a real-world policy-related 
problem at the local, state, federal, or international level. Typically, projects are informed by, 
and delivered to, outside stakeholders or clients who work with the students to help formulate, 
structure, and/or carry out the project. Students work in a team environment under the guid -
ance of a faculty adviser. Under special circumstances students may work individually with 
the approval of the program. (Enrollment in this course requires permission from the depart -
ment offering the course.)  Research 6, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
PUBL-510 Technological Innovation and Public Policy
Technological innovation, the incremental and revolutionary improvements in technology, has 
been a major driver in economic, social, military, and political change. This course will intro -
duce generic models of innovation that span multiple sectors including: energy, environment, 
health, and bio- and information-technologies. The course also analyzes how governments 
choose policies, such as patents, to spur and shape innovation and its impacts on the economy 
and society. Students will be introduced to a global perspective on innovation policy includ -
ing economic competitiveness, technology transfer and appropriate technology.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)PUBL-515 Business and Public Policy
This class focuses on the interaction and interplay between business/industries and govern -
ment policies in the U.S. context. We will discuss how different types of public policy, including 
laws and regulations, taxes, subsidies, and other government interventions and programs can 
directly or indirectly influence industries and markets, business environments and decisions, 
economic activities and development, and long-term technological change. Policies to be dis -
cussed include antitrust laws, environmental health and safety regulations, technology policy, 
labor policy, and intellectual property rights, among others. Specific policies may vary accord -
ing to the instructor. We will also critically look at how business participates in and impacts 
the policy making process (e.g., through interest group activities, lobbying, and campaigning 
finance) and the larger societal needs for government services. Lastly, we will explore the risks 
and benefits of business acting in cooperation with or, in some cases, as a replacement for pub -
lic policy.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)

Science, Technology and Society
STSO-120 Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course explores the human condition within an environmental context by emphasiz -
ing critical environmental problems facing humans on both a global and regional scale. The 
approach will be interdisciplinary. The issues, their causes, and their potential solutions will 
be analyzed with respect to ethical, social, historical, political, scientific, and technological fac -
tors.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
STSO-140 Science, Technology, and Values
This course explores the concepts and effects of science and technology on society, analyz -
es the relationship between science and technology, examines how each has come to play a 
major role today, and looks at how science and technology have affected and been affected by 
our values. This course also considers the environmental aspects of science and technology. 
Science and technology are often assumed to be value free, yet people, guided by individual and 
societal values, develop the science and technology. In turn, the choices people make among 
the opportunities provided by science and technology are guided by their individual values.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
STSO-201 Science and Technology Policy
Examines how local, state, federal and international policies are developed to influence inno -
vation, the transfer of technology and industrial productivity in the United States and other 
selected nations.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)

analysis of sustainability within a socio-cultural context. This is a required course for the 
environmental science degree program.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  177
College of Liberal ArtsSTSO-230 Foundations of Engagement and Community Transformation
Are you passionate about addressing the socially-complex, wicked problems of our time? This 
interdisciplinary, active-learning course will lay the groundwork for students who want to par -
ticipate in future place-based community-engaged research, development or design projects 
that build on community strengths and address community determined challenges. Through 
literature reviews, discussions, cases study analysis, role plays, debates, reflective writing, and 
visits with experienced community practitioners, we will explore the larger context of the 
systems within which we live and how others have engaged in efforts to improve commu -
nity wellbeing both locally and globally. We will strive for a more nuanced understanding of 
our world and its power dynamics from various perspectives. We will investigate the context 
in which community and economic development has traditionally occurred, how technol -
ogy has been involved, and the effects of projects and activities on the “beneficiaries”. We 
will investigate best practices including mindsets, worldviews, skills, processes, and tools for 
community-driven positive change. Finally we will use all our learnings to develop our own 
evaluation framework and apply it to a current community project. This course incorporates 
humanities and social science approaches and counts for general education requirements.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-240 Social Consequences of Technology
Modern society is increasingly based on technology. With each advance due to technology, 
unanticipated problems are also introduced. Society must define and solve these problems or 
the advances may be diluted or lost. In this course we study several interactions between tech -
nology and the world in which we live. We investigate how various technologies developed 
and compare the expected effects of the new technologies with the actual results.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
STSO-246 History of Women in Science and Engineering
Using biographical and social-historical approaches, this course examines the history of 
women's involvement in science and engineering since the birth of modern science in the sev -
enteenth century; the historical roots of gender bias in the Western scientific enterprise; and 
the influx of women into science and engineering since the mid-to-late 20th century. Cross-
listed with women's and gender studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-321 Face of the Land
Based on field trips and critical readings, this course explores how the land around us has been 
shaped and reshaped through a variety of geological forces and historical developments. By 
considering the natural landforms of the United States (and other countries, as appropriate), 
students see how the nature of land has determined its value. As technological innovations 
occur, old relationships with the land have been altered. Thus the course offers students a his -
torical approach to the relationship of technology and society, as evidence by the landscape. 
The seminar format for this course will also advance students' writing, speaking, and research 
skills.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-325 History of the Environmental Sciences
This course surveys the history of the environmental sciences from antiquity to the present. The 
environmental sciences include those sciences that deal with the Earth's physical and organic 
environments, ranging from geology and biology to evolutionary theory and ecology. A promi -
nent theme is the influence of social, religious, and political ideas on theories of how the Earth 
and its plants and animals have evolved.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
STSO-326 History of Ecology and Environmentalism
This course explores the history of ecological science, from the eighteenth century to the pres -
ent, and it features the political use of ecological ideas in environmental debates, from the 
19th century to the present. We investigate how social and political ideas have influenced 
ecological science, how ecological concepts have influenced Western politics and society, and 
how different generations of ecological researchers have viewed their role in society.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-330 Energy and the Environment
This course will examine contemporary energy issues, with particular emphasis placed on the 
environmental implications associated with energy consumption and production. Students 
will learn about various energy technologies and fuels (including nuclear, coal, oil, natural 
gas, solar, biomass, and wind) and the environmental tradeoffs associated with each of these 
energy systems.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-335 Industry, Environment, and Community in Rochester
This course examines Rochester through the lens of industrialization, immigration, techno -
logical innovation, and environmental change between the 1890s and 1990s. This class blends 
readings and discussion with experiential learning and community-based research projects to 
help students understand community identity as a result of changes in livelihoods, immigra -
tion, and environment. Students will examine these social changes in both a local and global 
context. Students will have a better appreciation for the way historical forces shape a contem -
porary sense of place.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)STSO-340 Technological Disasters
Disasters represent a disruption to daily life, with technological disasters defined as disasters 
resulting from human-made causes, where failures in modern technology create both acute and 
ongoing dangers for communities. This course focuses on how human technological advanc -
es can have adverse impacts on the communities those innovations are meant to improve. 
Through an investigation of technological systems and case-specific technologies, combined 
with ecological, social, and political systems, the causes, consequences, and long-term implica -
tions of technological disasters are considered. The course will examine cases that range from 
the actual to the anticipated, such as the New Orleans levee failures, Flint water crisis, Dalkon 
shield contraception, large-scale networked hacks, CRISPR-created and/or naturally-occurring 
superviruses, voting poll technology failures, and AI, in the context of the societal systems of 
modern industrial capitalism. Special attention will be paid to aspects of social vulnerability 
which make the impacts of technological disasters different for various sub-populations within 
their respective communities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
STSO-341 Biomedical Issues: Science and Technology
A study of the impact of science and technology on life, our view of life and of the value issues 
that arise from this impact.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
STSO-342 Gender, Science, and Technology
This course explores the importance of gender within Western science and technology. It con -
siders how masculine and feminine identities are socially and culturally shaped, how sex and 
gender are being significantly transformed, and how rethinking gendered practices may help 
make science and technology fairer and more responsive. Cross-listed with women's and gen -
der studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-345 Makers of Modern Science
Approaches the history of science through studying biographies of modern scientists. Modern 
science is understood to be science from the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th cen -
turies to the present. Emphasis will be on recent scholarship devoted to analyzing science in 
context, i.e., the way it actually develops through the lives of individuals, in particular social 
and political contexts.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
STSO-346 Technology in American History
This course explores the development of technology in American history, from the time of first 
contact between Europeans and Native Americans to the present. It emphasizes, for differ -
ent periods in American history: the technological contributions of individuals or distinctive 
groups, the main features of important technological systems, and the way technology shaped-
-and was shaped by--the social, economic, and political institutions of the time.)  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-421 Environmental Policy
This course introduces students to federal, state, and local environmental policies and the 
various policy paths leading to their establishment. Students will understand how societal 
values inform the content of environmental policies and the impacts, in turn, of these policies 
on society. In addition, the class will explore how environmental economics informs the new 
tools of environmental policy. The course covers a range of environmental policies at the U.S. 
and international levels addressing problems such as air and water pollution, climate change, 
energy use, and community sustainability.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-422 Great Lakes
This course utilizes the Great Lakes Basin as an integrating context for understanding global 
environmental issues. Examining the basin through an interdisciplinary environmental lens the 
class applies social science approaches to environmental problem solving. Students assess the 
local, regional, national and international scope of Great Lakes environmental issues through 
lecture, role-play, and field experiences and consider the importance of government action, 
public policy, ethics, economics, sociology, history, and engineering while applying social sci -
ence analysis skills such as surveys, interviews, and content analysis to better understand the 
depth of local environmental problems and their potential solutions. Environmental science 
majors prepare a proposal for an environmental consulting project.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-425 Nature and Quantification
In this course, students will examine the ways in which “nature,” broadly conceived, has been 
quantified, standardized, and in many cases commodified in the modern West – often in 
the context of the natural sciences, government bureaucracies, capitalist markets, or some 
combination of the three. Reading and discussing broadly across history, science studies, 
anthropology, philosophy, and ecology, students will gain multidisciplinary perspectives on 
modern informational thinking, and develop analytical tools for assessing contemporary issues 
related to the quantified environment.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)178 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsSTSO-441 Cyborg Theory:  (Re)thinking the Human Experience in the 21st Century
The developing cybernetic organism or cyborg challenges traditional concepts of what it means 
to be human. Today medical science and science fiction appear to merge in ways unimagined 
a century ago. By exploring scientific and cultural theories, science fiction, and public experi -
ence, this class examines the history and potential of the cyborg in Western cultures.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-442 Science, Technology, and Society Classics
STS classics are books that involve science or technology and that also have notable social sig -
nificance. In this course students will read several such books to advance their understanding 
of how society learns about, explores, and evaluates science and technology. The seminar for -
mat for this course will also advance students' writing, speaking, and research skills.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall)
STSO-445 The Natural Sciences in Western History
This course explores the development of the natural sciences in Western history, from ancient 
times to the present. It emphasizes how astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology have 
changed over time, and it seeks to place those changes in their social, economic, cultural, and 
religious contexts.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-488 Topics in Environmental Studies
This course will focus on a special problem or topical area in the field of Environmental Studies. 
Topics and specific content and methods vary from year to year or Semester to Semester. This 
course may count for minors and immersions with the permission of the Department. The 
STS Department Chair and individual instructors may be contacted for details.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 1 - 6 (Annual)
STSO-489 Topics in Science, Technology, and Society
This course will focus on a special problem or topical area in the field of STS. Topics and specific 
content and methods vary from year to year or Semester to Semester. This course may count 
for minors and immersions with the permission of the Department. The STS Department Chair 
and individual instructors may be contacted for details.  Lecture 3, Credits 1 - 6 (Fall, Summer)
STSO-510 Interdisciplinary Capstone Seminar
This course is an upper-level undergraduate seminar that explores how science, technology, 
society, environment and policy are understood in contemporary and historical contexts. The 
course brings together a variety of views and readings to offer an interdisciplinary approach to 
understanding the complex ways in which citizens make and understand the world. (Enrollment 
in Department of STS/Public Policy)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
STSO-521 Biodiversity and Society
This course explores the problems, issues, and values stemming from the current massive loss 
of biodiversity. Various justifications for preserving or conserving biodiversity will be exam -
ined. Although principals of conservation biology are presented, the social/cultural dimensions 
of the issue will be emphasized.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
STSO-550 Sustainable Communities
The concept of sustainability has driven many national and international policies. More recent -
ly, we have become aware that unless we physical build and rebuild our communities in ways 
that contribute to sustainability, making progress toward that goal is unlikely. It is equally 
important to recognize the social aspects of sustainability. In addition, it is at the local level 
that the goals of equity (a key consideration in community sustainability), most often achieved 
through citizen participation and collaborative processes are most easily realized. This course 
will broaden students understanding of the concept of sustainability, particularly the concept 
of social sustainability. This course focuses on sustainability as a way to bring light to the con -
nections between natural and human communities, between nature and culture, and among 
environmental, economic, and social systems. Working closely with local organizations, stu -
dents will explore the applicability of theoretical concepts.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
Sociology
SOCI-102 Foundations of Sociology
Sociology is the study of the social world and socialization processes. Sociologists study the 
broader picture of how societies are structured and organized through a macro-sociological 
analysis as well as how individuals create their own social reality symbolically through their 
interactions with others in a micro-sociological analysis. Students in this course will learn the 
fundamentals of each approach and come away with a sociological framework which they can 
critically apply to their own lives.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)SOCI-102H Honors Sociology
This course explores how sociological concepts, theories and research account for such social 
phenomena as socialization, deviance, social structure, stratification, political and religious 
affiliation and social change. It will also explore how social factors account for political and 
economic behavior and the speed and spread of technological change.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Fall, Spring)
SOCI-210 Black America-Culture and HipHop
This course examines the historical and contemporary conditions of Blacks in the U.S. We will 
explore African American culture as it is perceived by many African-Americans, and consider 
theoretical concepts related to immigration and the segmented assimilation of Black immi -
grant groups coming into the U.S. We will also address identity politics as it relates to race, 
class, and gender, oppression, as well as the art products that originate in Black communities. 
A particular emphasis will be placed on Hip Hop music, dance, and style as an expression of 
Black culture, identity, activism, and social influence (both nationally and globally).  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
SOCI-215 The Changing Family
Families are the microcosm of society. Sociological concepts and theories define the family as 
a fundamental institution that both mirrors and propels societal change. The field of family 
studies explores various parameters of family systems, including gender, race, class, ethnicity, 
sexuality, division of labor, marriage and divorce, children, and generational relations. In the 
wake of significant changes in family forms, experiences, and prevailing household arrange -
ments, the scope of sociological inquiry has expanded to meet the new realities of American 
family life.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
SOCI-220 Minority Group Relations
The course will provide a context in which to examine the multiple and contradictory social 
relations of domination, subordination, resistance, and empowerment. The kinds of ques -
tions we will explore focus on how power, knowledge, meaning, and cultural representation 
are organized. We will analyze a variety of political and ideological themes which bear upon 
the formation of minority group relations, their identity and how these themes complicate 
the processes by which people construct their understanding of the nation, world, of others, 
and themselves. Through reflection on theoretical texts and fictional works, as well as film 
and other popular media, we will consider for ourselves how culture is differently represented 
and signified, and how the politics of understanding and misunderstanding minority rela -
tions work through practices within and outside cultural institutions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Fall, Spring, Summer)
SOCI-225 Social Inequality
This course examines various forms of social inequality, including economic, political, health, 
higher education, race and sex inequality. It uses a variety of sociology's ideas to explain why 
these kinds of inequality exist, how they persist and what can be done about them.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Spring)
SOCI-230 Sociology of Work
This course analyzes and assesses social relations of paid labor. Sociology's major ideas about 
the ways we work will be examined and applied to numerous important topics such as: work -
place organization, unions, labor legislation, health and safety, workplace culture, interplays 
between work and family, experiences of work as alienating or satisfying, inequalities at work, 
and social mobility.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
SOCI-235 Women, Work, and Culture
In this course, we analyze historical and contemporary patterns of gender, race/ethnicity, sex -
uality, and the organization of work. Using the theoretical perspectives we analyze the work 
historically undertaken by women in societies and its relationship to broader political and eco -
nomic structures. While our primary focus is on the U.S., we will also conduct a cross-cultural 
analysis of gender and work in developing and industrializing societies. Specific issues include 
gender discrimination (e.g., wage discrimination, sexual harassment), sexuality, reproduction, 
and women organizing to control their work and working conditions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 
(Fall, Spring, Summer)
SOCI-240 Deaf Culture in America
This course is an introductory survey of Deaf culture in the United States. Students will study 
the scholarly literature pertaining to various social groups in the Deaf community and have 
contact with their members. This course will familiarize students with the characteristics of 
Deaf Culture, as well as general perceptions of the Deaf community within the dominant main -
stream society.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  179
College of Liberal ArtsSOCI-246 Gender and Health
This course examines connections between gender and health that are both conceptual and 
empirical. Students will explore the causes of gender-based differences in health outcomes 
through case studies of sexual and reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS epidemics and violence. 
Students will also examine global gender and health trends. The course concludes with an 
examination of gender inequity in health care and policy implications of these inequities.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
SOCI-295 Global Public Health
Global health is a term that reflects a complex series of problems, policies, institutions and aspi -
rations that have only recently made their way to the global stage. From its earliest days, global 
health was guided by principles in public health that situate the nation-state as responsible for 
the health of its population. While international health and tropical medicine, the precursors 
to global health, was driven by the distinction between wealthy and poor nations, global health 
today, as this course explores, is oriented to the unequal burden of disease around the world. 
The course will consider major global health challenges, programs, and policies through an inte -
grated social science lens. After placing global health in historical context, we will focus on how 
the science of disease cannot be dissociated from the social context and policies that both drive 
the emergence of disease(s) and respond to the unequal burden of disease around the world. 
We will analyze current and emerging global health priorities, including emerging infectious 
diseases, poverty, conflicts and emergencies, health inequity, health systems reforms, and major 
global initiatives for disease prevention and health promotion.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
SOCI-300 Sociology of American Life
This course will examine major U.S. institutions and dominant values that pattern everyday 
life. It will focus on the nation’s multi-national corporations, mass media, lawmaking, schools 
and the military, and dominant ideologies and values that guide these institutions such as the 
American dream, individualism, competition, faith in technology, consumerism and democ -
racy. Alternative organizations and countercultures will be studied. The course will examine 
the interconnections between the U.S. and other nations as expressed by such issues as inter -
national trade agreements, cultural diffusion, environmental degradation, and war.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
SOCI-301 Social and Cultural Theory
This course explores influential classical and contemporary theories regarding society and cul -
ture. Students will assess the utility of different theories in addressing key enduring questions 
regarding human behavior, the organization of society, the nature of culture, the relationship 
between the individual and society, social control and social conflict, social groups and social 
hierarchy, the operation of power, cultural and social change, and the interplay between the 
global and the local. Theories will be marshaled to shed light on contemporary social and cultur -
al phenomena and problems such as crime, violence, exploitation, modernity, and globalization. 
(Prerequisites: Successful completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) 
or International and Global Studies (INGS) is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3
SOCI-302 Qualitative Research
Learning about social and cultural groups is a complex and ethically sensitive process. We 
explore common qualitative research methods for social and cultural research. We evalu -
ate the utility of such methods for different purposes and contexts, including cross-cultural 
contexts. We consider common ethical dilemmas in research with human subjects, the ethi -
cal responsibilities of researchers, and common techniques for minimizing risks to subjects. 
(Prerequisites: Successful completion of one course in Anthropology (ANTH), Sociology (SOCI) 
or International and Global Studies (INGS) is required.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3
SOCI-303 Statistics in the Social Sciences
The research conducted by sociologists and anthropologists generates large, complex data 
sets that are difficult to interpret subjectively. We will explore the basic quantitative tools that 
sociologists and anthropologists can use to understand these data sets and learn how to craft a 
research question and research design that utilize quantitative data, how to select appropriate 
quantitative techniques and apply them, how to present results, and how to critically evaluate 
quantitatively based knowledge claims.  Lab 2, Lecture 2, Credits 3SOCI-305 Crime and Human Rights: Sociology of Atrocities
How is the murder of one person different from that of one million? Why is one act a crime 
while the other simply history? While mass atrocities have occurred, and continue to occur, 
throughout human history, it is only until recently that international laws started to name and 
criminalize these atrocities as human rights violations. This course revolves around the worst 
mass atrocities in recent human history and the responses they receive, focusing on violent 
crimes perpetrated by the state and the emerging human rights regime in response to such 
crimes after WWII. As a class, we will seek answers to questions such as: Why do ordinary 
people participate in extreme violence against their neighbors? How is violence sanctioned and 
organized by the state different from interpersonal violence? Who is responsible for state-sanc -
tioned violence? What is the role of those who do not participate in or stop the violence? What is 
the role of human rights and human rights laws in preventing state-sanctioned violence? What 
are the possible responses to state-sanctioned violence under human rights laws? What are the 
consequences of such responses? Whether/how does social context matter in the way mass 
atrocities unfold and the responses they receive? To answer these questions, we will examine 
historical documents, watch movies, read literature, and study scholarly work. This course will 
be useful for students who seek careers in areas such as international law, diplomacy, human 
rights advocacy/prosecution, and criminal justice in general.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
SOCI-322 Health and Society
What would a healthy society look like? What questions should we be asking of those in power 
to ensure health equity? What is health equity? The objective of this course is to develop a soci -
ological language for answering these and other questions. To do so, students will evaluate the 
relationship between health and society – that is, the connections between contemporary health 
disparities and today’s social, physical, and political economic environments. This includes 
an analysis of macro-factors (climate change, environmental pollution, global and/or nation -
al economies, laws) and micro-factors (social media, neighborhood conditions, green spaces, 
poor- or low-quality housing, and leisure spaces). The course emphasizes that health is impact -
ed by the social circumstances into which people are born; inequitable distributions of power; 
and social/legal categories of exclusion and inclusion. Though sociological in orientation, this 
course resonates with the disciplinary and professional aims of medical anthropologists, public 
health professionals, community health practitioners, and anyone committed to eradicating 
health disparities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)
SOCI-330 Urban (In)Justice
With a focus on forms of (in)justice in urban communities worldwide, we investigate the impact 
of race, class, and gender and related systems of unequal power relations on perpetuating 
patterns of social, political, economic, and environmental oppression (policing, hunger, pol -
lution, violence, disease). How do ways of governing urban populations affect the lives of inner 
city residents and their demands for justice when attempting to navigate the everyday urban 
worlds? Specific course topics include both historical and contemporary perspectives on urban 
(in)justice locally, in Rochester NY, and nationally, across the U.S., and in a global comparative 
framework. Thereby the effects of crime, violence, and inequality on people in urban neigh -
borhoods are also examined among and within nations. By the end of the semester, students 
should be able to identify and explain various theories that seek to explain (in)justice patterns 
in the urban context at local, national and global levels.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
SOCI-345 Urban Poverty
Urban poverty has been recognized as a persistent problem in the United States since the middle 
of the last century. In many cities, poverty is associated with high levels of teenage pregnancy, 
low levels of employment, limited educational attainment, chronic community-based health 
problems, and high levels of crime. This course examines causes, consequences, and proposed 
policy solutions to urban poverty. Special emphasis will be paid to U.S. urban poverty.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
SOCI-355 CyberActivism: Diversity, Sex, and the Internet
Sociologists look to cyberspace to test theories of technology diffusion and media effects on 
society. This course explores the Internet’s impact on communities, political participation, 
cultural democracy, and diversity. How have digital technologies and electronic information 
flows shaped or diminished inequalities of gender, sex, and race? For instance: new electron -
ic technologies have pushed the cultural and physical boundaries of how we have sex; with 
whom we have sex; and with what we have sex and/or have observed having sex, such as sex 
toys and avatars. The sociological implications of this new technology depend on economic, 
legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. The 
course analyzes such new forms of cyber-democracy with a focus on issues of gender, sex, and 
race.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring, Summer)180 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsSOCI-361 Sociology of Numbers
Much of the knowledge of our social worlds has been digitized. This course explores how social 
technologies shape our relationships, personal lives, and sense of self. The metric manufacture 
of diversity has produced new forms of population management and inequality. Our biographic 
histories as citizens, consumers, workers/professionals, parents, lovers, and social media users 
are collected as data-bites and assessed in metric terms, thereby forging new sets of identities. 
The transformation of people into numerical entities is an act of statistical objectification. This 
process frames the creation of social and racial typologies, and is well demonstrated by the US 
census. Students will investigate the formation of racial, ethnic, and gender identities in the 
context of the accelerated desire to digitize humanity.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
SOCI-395 Borders:Humans, Boundaries, and Empires
Borders are more than walls; they are social constructions with real consequences. This course 
examines the creation and consequences of borders. It discusses how borders developed histori -
cally, how borders function as tools of population management in places and systems far from 
the borderlands, and the politics and experiences of border crossing. We will look for borders 
both between and within nation states when addressing these issues. The course will utilize a 
variety of materials including but not limited to scholarly sources, policy transcripts, popular 
cultural products (e.g. films and TV shows), and art (e.g. poetry, paintings). Students will play 
an active role in determining specific course topics, though they can expect to discuss a range 
of relevant issues including contemporary immigration politics, Indigenous rights, the war on 
terror, border disputes and armed conflicts, privatization of immigration management, dis -
placement and segregation of domestic populations, and border activism. This course provides 
students with tools that ground and expand their understanding of borders, preparing them for 
participation in one of the most important public debates of our time. The purview of this course 
is relevant for those who aspire toward professions in public policy, law enforcement, public 
service, law, and community-organizing, among others.  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
SOCI-451 Economics of Women and the Family
Women make choices concerning marriage, fertility and labor market participation on the 
basis of many factors, including government policies targeting those decisions. This course 
uses economic theory and empirical research in order to describe the changing demographic 
profile of families, poverty, and the labor force and to explore how economic theory and prac -
tice fit into the larger social science goals of describing human behavior by focusing on women 
and on the family.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
SOCI-489 Topics in Sociology

Visual Arts
VISL-100 Introduction to Visual Arts
This course will develop students' ability in perceiving worth in objects of art through consid -
eration of fundamental concepts in painting, sculpture and architecture, involving analysis, 
interpretation and principles of aesthetics.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
VISL-120 Introduction to Film
This course provides the student with an introduction to film as an art form. The course pres -
ents a vocabulary for film analysis as well as the critical and analytical skills for interpreting 
films. The course examines the major aesthetic, structural, historical, and technical components 
of film. It considers how a film works, by looking internally at the multiple aspects that com -
prise the construction of a film, and externally at how a film affects the viewers. Students will 
watch a variety of feature films, primarily American, ranging in date from the 1940's through 
the 2000's. Clips from alternative films and foreign films will also be screened and discussed. 
Any artistic background in film, music, theatre, painting, sculpture, etc., is helpful, but no 
specific technical knowledge of film, video, or photography is required or expected.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
VISL-140 Introduction to Visual Culture
This course provides an introduction to Visual Culture studies, an interdisciplinary field of 
study that explores the ways in which our lives are shaped through contact with, and consump -
tion of, images, designed objects and visual forms of media, communication, and information. 
Students will develop a critical understanding of different aspects of contemporary visual cul -
ture as well as an awareness of its recent historical development.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, 
Spring, Summer)
VISL-206 Queer Looks
In this course we examine representations of queer sexuality in art, film and popular culture 
beginning in the repressive 1950s, followed by the Stonewall Riots of 1969. We situate the birth 
of gay liberation in the U.S. in the context of the civil rights struggles, feminism and the anti-
war movement. We turn to the work of Andy Warhol that looms over the post-war period, 
challenged subsequently by the onset of AIDS and the work of General Idea and Act-Up, on the 
one hand, and the more graphically provocative work of Robert Mapplethorpe, on the other. 
We examine the diversification of the queer community as transgendered identity asserts itself 
and the opening of popular culture to issues of diverse sexual identities. We explore expres -
sions of queer sensibility outside of North America and Europe. We turn finally to the issue of 
gay marriage, both in the U.S. and abroad.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  181
College of Liberal ArtsVISL-295 Global Craftivism, Gender and Handwork
The course focuses on how traditionally feminine and domestic handcrafts have been thrust 
into the public sphere for social activist work in a highly visual manner. Students will examine, 
from both intellectual and practical perspectives, large-scale examples of craft activism both 
within the U.S. and internationally, focusing on the connections to political movements and 
how craft is made politically visual. The role of craft as an organizing force, typically enacted 
by women and gender minorities in situations of physical and personal vulnerability, will be 
investigated through readings centered on the historical ties of craft to activism and social 
reform in the U.S. For example, students will study the role of handwork in the Suffragist and 
Abolitionist movements and in the American Revolution with women’s use of “homespun” 
cloth. Attention will also be paid to the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt in the late 20th 
century. Expanding beyond the U.S., the course will analyze how craft can transform into a 
narrative of personal or communal identity and an ethnicity-preserving tool through case stud -
ies such as those from Chile (Arpilleras), Laos (Hmong story cloths), Argentina (Mothers of 
the Plaza de Mayo kerchiefs), India (Khadi cloth), England (Greenwich Commons Women’s 
Peace Camp and quilts), and Myanmar (street crochet for Democracy). Close attention will 
also be paid to the role of handcraft as a rallying force in organizing efforts relating to current 
issues such as reproductive justice, women’s rights, racial justice, LGBTQIA+ rights, climate 
and environmental justice, and to how craft activist campaigns are organized and disseminated 
through social media. During the course, students will work at transforming a contemporary 
social issue they care about into the theme of their own final project to be unveiled by the end 
of the semester.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
VISL-310 Media Production Lab: Project Development, Pitch and Funding
In this tech-forward environment, students will gain hands-on media-production experience 
and exposure to innovative technologies to enhance their storytelling and media capabili -
ties. Students will develop a project, business plan (where appropriate) and pitch for entry in 
campus competitions, and will learn how to concisely “sell” their innovative media ideas, and 
prototype, in a succinct and compelling way to possible funders. Students will also learn how 
to navigate funding opportunities that are internal to and external to RIT, how to identify gaps 
in the media-production landscape, and how to make themselves distinct from competitors. 
At the end of the course, students will have produced, and pitched, their own innovative media 
project ready for competition.  Lec/Lab 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
VISL-320 Contemporary Cinema: Fact and Fiction
We will study cinema in the United States and abroad from the mid-20th century to con -
temporary screen cultures. We will consider shorts, war documentaries, biographical and 
autobiographical films, animation, mockumentaries, video diaries, and immersive installa -
tions. Questions we will ask include: How does cinema represent or transform social and 
historical events in local and global contexts? Which ethical and aesthetic responsibilities does 
a filmmaker have to their audience and filmed subjects? What ethical questions do the films 
raise for us as spectators? How do we understand the role of media technologies in the mak -
ing of these films? We will investigate the structures, techniques, and ideologies that identify 
cinematic practices as fiction or non-fiction and consider films that challenge these represen -
tational systems, helping us examine the line between fact and fiction. Students will complete 
a film critique as a class assignment.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
VISL-354 Exhibition Design
This course examines the history and practice of exhibition design. It reviews the history of 
exhibitions within the development of museum-like institutions. In this course the following 
aspects of exhibition design are considered: curatorial premise or theme, exhibition develop -
ment timeline, exhibition site, contracts and contractual obligations, budgets and fundraising, 
publicity material, didactic material, and exhibition design. The course includes field trips to 
local institutions and collections throughout the semester.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
VISL-372 American Film of the Studio Era
This course examines the history and aesthetics of the motion picture in the United States 
between the 1890s and the early 1960s; emphasis will be placed on the analysis of both the work 
of major American filmmakers and the development of major American film genres during the 
Classical Hollywood Studio period. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Griffith, Chaplin, 
Hawks, Ford, Capra, Welles, Curtiz, Wilder, Donen, Sirk, Ray, Hitchcock, and Kubrick. Genres 
to be covered include the melodrama, silent comedy, screwball comedy, western, thriller, film 
noir, newspaper film, and the gangster film. The films will be studied within the context of con -
temporary cultural and political events, and will be discussed from several viewpoints, including 
aesthetic, technical, social, and economic. The ways in which gender and class are constructed 
through the movies will also be a major focus of study.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Annual)VISL-373 American Film Since the Sixties
This course examines the history and aesthetics of the motion picture in the United States since 
the late 1960s, when the classical studio era ended. Emphasis will be placed on the analysis 
of both the work of major American filmmakers and the evolution of major American film 
genres between 1967 and 2001. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Kazan, Cassavetes, 
Penn, Coppola, Scorsese, Spielberg, Allen, Seidelman, Lee, Burton, Altman, Tarantino, Coen, 
and Lynch. The course will consider the evolution of such traditional Hollywood genres as the 
gangster film, the romantic comedy, and the Hollywood movie, study the development of new, 
blended genres, investigate the rise of the blockbuster, explore the rise of the Independents, 
and follow the aesthetic changes that occurred since the 1967. The films will be studied within 
the context of contemporary cultural and political events, and will be discussed from several 
viewpoints, including aesthetic, technical, social, and economic. The ways in which gender, 
race, and class are constructed through the movies will also be a major focus of study.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Spring)
VISL-374 Art in the Age of the New Deal
In this course we examine art in the age of the New Deal; that is, the art of the 1920's and 
the 1930's, with a particular emphasis on the artwork produced through the programs of the 
Roosevelt Administration's New Deal. These programs sponsored the visual arts, as well as 
film, theater, literature, music, and dance. We study the art produced through this sponsor -
ship in the context of the evolution of twentieth century modernism, mostly European, that 
had begun to influence American art. We will look at the stylistic and ideological affinities of 
the figurative style, known as the American scene, with the Mexican muralists of the 1920's 
and examine other government-sponsored social realist art of the 1930's, notably German and 
Russian.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
VISL-376 Visual Culture Theory
Visual Culture studies recognize the predominance of visual forms of media, communication, 
and information in the contemporary world, investigating both “high" cultural forms such as 
fine art, design, and architecture and popular "low" cultural forms associated with mass media 
and communications. Visual Culture studies represents a turn in the discourse of the visual, 
which had focused on content-based, critical readings of images, and has since broadened 
its approach to additionally question the ways in which our consumption and production of 
images and image based technologies are structured. Analyzing images from a social-histori -
cal perspective, visual culture asks: what are the effects of images? Can the visual be properly 
investigated with traditional methodologies, which have been based on language, not imagery? 
How do images visualize social difference? How are images viewed by varied audiences? How 
are images embedded in a wider culture and how do they circulate?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
VISL-377 Imag(in)ing Rochester
This course examines the ways in which culture, ethnicity, languages, traditions, governance, 
policies and histories interact in the production of the visual experience. We will approach 
the campus of RIT and the city of Rochester and their various urban spatial forms as image 
experiences, subject to interpretative strategies and the influence of other discourses. We will 
wander the well-traveled and the unbeaten paths, participating in and interrogating a wide 
range of our campus' and city's treasures and embarrassments, secrets and norms. In addition 
to these field trips, we will be reading from literature and cultural studies, as well as viewing 
films, advertisements and websites, and possibly attending theatrical and music performances 
or sporting events.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
VISL-383 Traumatic Images
This course investigates visual culture and its imagistic response to life's crises. Problems of 
identity and identification will be explored and confronted through works of photography, 
painting, mixed media, new media and film of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Beginning 
with the late 19th Century vogue for images of hysterical women, crippled black-sheep fam -
ily members and dead loved ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider the 
last century's fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence, struggle and survival 
and then the 21st century's emphasis on terrorism. Specifically, we will focus on the gender -
ing of images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical 
distinction between private and public, personal, and collective experience and manage the 
often conflicting responsibilities to self, family, religion, race, nation, and society.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)182 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsVISL-384 Art of Dying
This course explores the experience of dying a profoundly human and universal experience 
as it is represented by artists who are themselves facing immanent death. The unique and 
deeply personal process of each dying artist is crucially informed by social, cultural and his -
torical as well as artistic contexts. The course will focus primarily on visual artists and writers 
living with and dying of disease - such as AIDS, cancer and cystic fibrosis as well as mortality 
and age. Topics such as aesthetics, artistic media, representation, grief, bereavement, illness, 
care-giving, aging, and the dying process will be considered within the context of issues of 
race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, gender and community values. Some of the artists covered 
will be Jo Spence, Hannah Wilke, Elias Canetti, Bob Flanagan, Herve Guibert, Tom Joslin, 
Laurie Lynd, Audre Lorde, Charlotte Salomon, Keith Haring, Frida Kahlo, Bas Jan Ader, Ted 
Rosenthal, Felix Gonzalez Torres, Keith Haring, Eric Steel, Derek Jarman, Eric Michaels, and 
David Wojnarowicz. We will also explore some of the critical theory of Roland Barthes, Michel 
Foucault, Elaine Scarry, Susan Sontag, and Ross Chambers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
VISL-388 Gender and Contemporary Art
This course traces the historical development of women’s activism in the art world from the 
1970s to the present. We will interpret how this art activism, which artists and scholars alike 
have referred to as the feminist art movement, has examined how gender informs the ways art 
is made, viewed, conceptualized in history and theory, and exhibited in museums and visual 
culture, in a range of cultural contexts. We will also analyze how current artists, critics, and 
curators continue to build on this history, in particular how they use the concept of gender 
intersectionality to develop a variety of new creative practices, theories, modes of exhibition 
and social engagement.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
VISL-390 Visual Activism
This course is a history of visual activism from the 20th century to now. The course asks: how 
is activism represented and disseminated to engage audiences? How is the public sphere in the 
United States and abroad shaped by visual activist practices? What visual languages are used as 
forms of documentation, communication, persuasion, and creative expression in the service 
of social change? We examine a range of examples in their local and global contexts, including 
counter-culture photography and film, poster graphics, graffiti art, comics and political car -
toons, social media, performance, urban interventions, installations, and new media.  Lecture 
3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
VISL-440 Deaf Art and Cinema
Students will examine the context in which specific cultural groups have chosen to create works 
about their experiences. They will go on to explore a wide range of artistic works representing 
the Deaf experience in visual arts and cinema. Students will be expected to analyze works in 
terms of cultural symbols and themes. Attention will be given to historical context (personal 
and collective) that has helped to shape many of these works, motifs, and messages. Students 
will write and present in-depth papers examining specific works and artists/filmmakers. In 
addition, students will be expected to create an original artwork and a collaborative short film.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring)
VISL-489 Topics in Visual Culture
Visual Culture is an interdisciplinary field of study that explores the role of visual media 
in everyday life and its critical function in the dissemination of ideas in the public sphere. 
Emphasizing comparative critical approaches to the convergence of art and popular media, 
courses engage globalized visual media ranging from photography, television and film, to 
new media, architecture, design, and art (painting, sculpture and multimedia forms) in the 
context of such social arenas as art, news, science, advertising, and popular culture.  Lecture

Women and Gender Studies
WGST-200 Foundations of Women and Gender Studies
Women’s and Gender Studies is the academic manifestation of feminism. This interdisciplin -
ary course interrogates the social constructions, political systems, and historical rhetorics that 
have produced and maintain hegemonic power structures. In this course you will examine key 
feminist, queer, and critical race writings and discourses, study the rise of feminist thought, and 
consider the history of women’s activism and the women’s rights movements from Suffrage to 
the present day. The course will also consider the application of feminist theory made visible 
through the rise of new and intersectional social identity movements.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)WGST-205 Feminist Practices of Inquiry
This course aims at introducing students to the diverse ways in which feminist and gender 
studies practitioners (scholars, writers, artists, and activists) have critically analyzed, chal -
lenged, and creatively reinvented predominant methods, models, and practices of knowledge 
production in various areas of the natural and social sciences, the medical arts, the humani -
ties, and the visual and performing arts. Questions to be considered include: What constitutes 
feminist practices of inquiry? How do feminist research practices approach issues of objectiv -
ity and subjectivity? How does one formulate a feminist question? What key questions guide 
feminist researchers and how can we apply those questions to a variety of research topics? 
How do feminist practices of inquiry intersect with race, class, gender, ethnicity, national -
ity, sexualities, identity-formation processes, (dis)abilities, age? How do feminist research 
practices produce transformations, emancipation, and increased fairness of representation?

WGST-210 Introduction to LGBTQ+ Studies
This introductory course examines a broad range of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer issues within the historical, psychological, racial, theological, cultural, and legal contexts 
in which we live. Students will learn the historical and theoretical foundations of LGBTQ+ stud -
ies as well as the contemporary implications for family, work, religion, and law for LGBTQ+ 
people and the mainstream society. Students will have the opportunity to compare the regu -
lation of sexual orientation across different gender, racial, and socioeconomic communities.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-230 Men, Males, and Masculinities
Who and what defines a man? What challenges might the process of manhood present? How 
does one’s masculine expression align or not align with family or societal definitions? How are 
men harmed by unattainable ideas of manhood? What advantages and privileges come along 
with embodying maleness? What impacts does masculinity have on men’s relationships (with 
women, with other men, as fathers, as sons)? What does it mean to be a man of color, a work -
ing-class man or a gay man? Is masculinity innately violent or aggressive? This course uses a 
critical approach to examine individual, institutional, and societal understandings of what it 
means in general to be a man. It explores models of masculinity in conjunction with analy -
ses of race, class, disability, and sexuality. It analyzes the common and diverse experiences of 
how some human beings are socialized and/or choose to express their masculinity in healthy, 
unique, hegemonic and sometimes problematic ways. It probes how some models of (toxic or 
hegemonic) masculinity promote hierarchies of power and privilege in groups, organizations, 
and institutions. And it investigates ways in which toxic forms of masculinity can be broken 
down and rewritten to work toward a healthier, more just (and less oppressive) society for all.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-235 Women, Work, and Culture
In this course, we analyze historical and contemporary patterns of gender, race/ethnicity, sex -
uality, and the organization of work. Using the theoretical perspectives we analyze the work 
historically undertaken by women in societies and its relationship to broader political and eco -
nomic structures. While our primary focus is on the U.S., we will also conduct a cross-cultural 
analysis of gender and work in developing and industrializing societies. Specific issues include 
gender discrimination (e.g., wage discrimination, sexual harassment), sexuality, reproduction, 
and women organizing to control their work and working conditions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3

WGST-237 Psychology of Women
The purpose of this course is to examine the psychology and lives of girls and women. In 
addition to the influence of culture, biological and genetic differences will be highlighted for 
each of the different topics. The topics covered include gender stereotypes, the development 
of gender roles, gender comparisons, love relationships, sexuality, motherhood and violence 
against women. (Prerequisites: PSYC-101 or PSYC-101H or completion of one (1) 200 level

College of Liberal ArtsWGST-240 Human Sexuality
This course provides an overview of human sexuality through the lenses of biology and psy -
chology. What causes sexual behavior and why do some individuals display different sexual 
behaviors than others? Human sexual physiology, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are highly 
diverse. Coursework will examine the ways in which human sexuality varies among individu -
als, across groups, and throughout the lifespan. Multiple explanations for sexual behavior will 
be considered, drawing from evolutionary psychology, learning theory, social psychology, 
and biology. Atypical and harmful sexual behaviors will be addressed as well. Throughout the 
course, students will learn how social science research techniques have been used to expand 
the field of human sexuality and how empirical inquiry can differentiate myths from facts. 
(Prerequisites: PSYC-101 or PSYC-101H or completion of one (1) 200 level PSYC course.)

WGST-246 History of Women in Science and Engineering
Using biographical and social-historical approaches, this course examines the history of 
women's involvement in science and engineering since the birth of modern science in the sev -
enteenth century; the historical roots of gender bias in the Western scientific enterprise; and 
the influx of women into science and engineering since the mid-to-late 20th century. Cross-
listed with women's and gender studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-250 Domestic Violence
This course focuses on domestic violence in the United States and globally. Various types of 
domestic violence will be examined, including intimate partner violence, child abuse, and elder 
abuse. The course will also examine criminal justice responses to domestic violence, includ -
ing police, court processing of domestic violence cases and punishment of domestic violence 
offenders.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-255 Seminar on Sexual Violence
This course focuses on sexual violence in the United States and globally. Various types of sexual 
violence will be examined, including incest, elder abuse, and male victimization. The course 
will also examine criminal justice responses to sexual violence, including police, court process -
ing of sexual violence cases and punishment and treatment of sexual offenders. (Prerequisites: 
CRIM-110 or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-265 Women and Crime
This course deals with women as criminal offenders and as victims of crime, focusing upon 
theories about women in crime, types of crimes committed, patterns of criminality and the 
treatment of women offenders. Also examines the role of women as law enforcement officers, 
judges, lawyers and correctional officers in the criminal justice system. (Prerequisites: CRIM-
110 or equivalent course.)  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-282 Women, Gender, and Computing
Popular attention often focuses on a few prominent women in computing history, such as Ada 
Lovelace, Grace Hopper, and the ENIAC programmers. But many more women were part of 
this history: as inventors, programmers, operators, and users of information and communi -
cation technologies. Investigating their legacies, we will discuss in this course how computing 
turned into an increasingly masculine field, what it meant for women and men to work in a 
male-dominated field, how the gendering of computing technologies and algorithms affected 
the identities and lives of their users, and how gender intersected online and offline with other 
dimensions of diversity, such as class, race, and ability. This course provides the theoretical 
concepts and historical overview that allow for a historically informed discussion of women, 
gender, sexuality, and computing today.  Seminar 3, Credits 3 (Spring)

This course surveys women’s history in the United States from the colonial period to pres -
ent. The course moves chronologically and thematically, focusing on the diversity of women’s 
experiences across race, class, and geography as well as the construction of dominant gender 
norms. Topics include Native American, African American, and Euro-American women in 
colonial America; the Industrial Revolution and the ideology of domesticity, Women in the 
American West; women’s paid and unpaid work; sexuality and reproduction; women’s activ -
ism; and women’s experiences of immigration and family life.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)WGST-291 The History of Families and Children in the U.S.
The family is at the center of contemporary political debates involving social policies, gender 
roles, citizenship, marriage, and the role of the state. Politicians and commentators frequently 
invoke a mythical American family, one that is conflict-free, independent, and unchanging. 
These idealized depictions mask a far more complicated and richer historical reality of the devel -
opment of family structures in the U.S. This course will examine both the diverse experiences of 
actual families in the American past, including queer families, and changing ideologies about 
the family and childhood. Students will have the opportunity to write a history of their own 
family, or to complete an alternative research paper.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-295 Global Craftivism, Gender and Handwork
The course focuses on how traditionally feminine and domestic handcrafts have been thrust 
into the public sphere for social activist work in a highly visual manner. Students will examine, 
from both intellectual and practical perspectives, large-scale examples of craft activism both 
within the U.S. and internationally, focusing on the connections to political movements and 
how craft is made politically visual. The role of craft as an organizing force, typically enacted 
by women and gender minorities in situations of physical and personal vulnerability, will be 
investigated through readings centered on the historical ties of craft to activism and social 
reform in the U.S. For example, students will study the role of handwork in the Suffragist and 
Abolitionist movements and in the American Revolution with women’s use of “homespun” 
cloth. Attention will also be paid to the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt in the late 20th 
century. Expanding beyond the U.S., the course will analyze how craft can transform into a 
narrative of personal or communal identity and an ethnicity-preserving tool through case stud -
ies such as those from Chile (Arpilleras), Laos (Hmong story cloths), Argentina (Mothers of 
the Plaza de Mayo kerchiefs), India (Khadi cloth), England (Greenwich Commons Women’s 
Peace Camp and quilts), and Myanmar (street crochet for Democracy). Close attention will 
also be paid to the role of handcraft as a rallying force in organizing efforts relating to current 
issues such as reproductive justice, women’s rights, racial justice, LGBTQIA+ rights, climate 
and environmental justice, and to how craft activist campaigns are organized and disseminated 
through social media. During the course, students will work at transforming a contemporary 
social issue they care about into the theme of their own final project to be unveiled by the end 
of the semester.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall or Spring)
WGST-300 Feminist Leadership, Gender Equity and Empowerment
This course explores contemporary leadership styles through the lens of gender diversity. 
Relying upon a feminist social justice framework alongside models of intersectionality, stu -
dents will actively engage with a wide variety of gender and culture-informed literature and 
visual media sources, defining—in both theory and practice—what it means to be an inclusive 
and empowering leader in modern society. Some questions to consider will include: In a work 
environment, who is responsible for ensuring gender equity? Where does inclusion begin? 
How does our personal identity shape our view of leadership? How does our view of leader -
ship shape our identity? Why does gender matter in a professional environment? What role 
does feminism play in the construction of societal norms? What is the relation between leader -
ship, power relations, and authority? How does a feminist social justice framework affect and 
reorient traditional notions of leadership? How do leadership styles and models vary across 
cultures? What styles of leadership are needed to create more diverse, equitable, and inclusive 
workplaces, organizations, and societies?  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-305 Feminist Activism for Gender Justice
This course focuses on the many forms of feminist activisms and feminist strategies of grass -
roots social resistance in the U.S. and beyond. It centers women as agents of social change in 
the struggle to challenge gender stereotypes, sexism, and oppressive policies; organize to reduce 
social issues such as poverty, racism, homophobia, and violence; work to expand opportunities 
for gender equity and social justice; and confront barriers in education, the criminal justice 
system, and politics. Topics of investigation include feminist struggles against domestic and 
sexual violence (including emergent forms of sexual regulation and slavery, agendas of incarcer -
ation, and politics of immigration and housing) as well as the fight for personhood, citizenship, 
legal rights, property rights, rights to the land, water, and clean air, disability rights, personal 
freedom, suffrage, education, reproductive rights, workplace equality, and more. As there is a 
personal element to all forms of feminist social activism, the course will also engage questions 
such as: How do you envision yourself as an empowered, effective activist for gender justice? 
What strengths, resources, and commitments can you bring to your gender justice work? What 
social issues are you most passionate about? Students in the course will also create or partici -
pate in some activist project concerning a particularly pressing local, national or global social 
issue thereby melding theory and practice for increased gender justice in the world we live in.  
Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)184 Undergraduate Course Descriptions
College of Liberal ArtsWGST-309 Feminist Theory
This course examines the main currents in contemporary feminist thought. Feminist theory 
explores the nature and effects of categories of sex and gender upon our ways of living, thinking 
and doing, while also challenging how gendered assumptions might shape our conceptions of 
identity and inquiry more generally. Different conceptions of sex and gender will be discussed, 
and the course will investigate how these concepts affect our lives in both concrete and symbolic 
ways. Special attention will be paid to how gendered assumptions color our understanding of 
knowledge production, experiences of embodiment and emotion, public and private activi -
ties, and the nature of ethical decision making.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer)
WGST-318 Philosophies of Love,Sex, and Gender
Love is indeed one of the most central concerns in everyone’s life; yet, we spend very little time 
thinking conceptually about love in its various forms, aspects, implications, nuances, benefits, 
detriments, and harms. In this course, we will examine views from classical, medieval, modern, 
and contemporary thinkers on various kinds of love, including some controversial versions of 
it; we will consider the relation of love in its various forms to desire, emotions, physical inti -
macy, seduction, sex, sexuality, sexual orientation, and the construction of personal identity; 
and we will analyze how the various forms of love affect and are affected by gender norms, 
roles, and images.  Lecture 3, Credits 3
WGST-330 Performing Identity in Popular Media
This class is a critical, theoretical, and practical examination of the constitution and perfor -
mance of personal identity within popular media as it relates to identity politics in everyday 
life. Through lectures, readings, film, and critical writing, students will examine elements of 
personal identity and diversity in popular media in order to foster a deeper understanding of 
how identity is constructed and performed in society.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-335 Women and the Deaf Community
Deaf history, as a field, has often neglected the story of deaf women. Scholar Arlene B. Kelly 
has recently asked, Where is deaf herstory? This course seeks to correct that gender imbalance 
in deaf history. We will study deaf women's history. This will include a consideration of deaf-
blind women, as well, as women like Helen Keller were often the most famous deaf women of 
their era. But this course also seeks to look at the role of hearing women in deaf history. Hearing 
women dominated the field of deaf education in the late nineteenth century. They had a tremen -
dous impact on the lives of deaf children and the events of deaf educational history. Hearing 
women were also important figures in deaf history as mothers. As mothers of deaf children, 
hearing women were frequently asked to behave as teachers in the home. Their embrace of this 
role often led them to endorse oral education, and oppose the sign language. Hearing moth -
ers in this way were pitted against their adult deaf daughters, who frequently went on to learn 
sign language against their mothers' wishes. The historically complex relationship between 
women and the deaf community will be explored in this course.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-342 Gender, Science, and Technology
This course explores the importance of gender within Western science and technology. It con -
siders how masculine and feminine identities are socially and culturally shaped, how sex and 
gender are being significantly transformed, and how rethinking gendered practices may help 
make science and technology fairer and more responsive. Cross-listed with women's and gen -
der studies.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-351 Gender and Sexuality in Hispanic Studies
This course introduces students to the study of gender and sexuality in cultural production from 
the Hispanic world. Students will read, view, and discuss diverse works from a variety of histori -
cal periods and geographical regions that deal with gender identity, sexuality, and interrelated 
social movements. This course refines students' skills through discussions, presentations, and 
writing exercises on readings, lectures, and film screenings. Students will also develop research 
skills as they complete a project on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor. The 
critical approach that will inform this course is feminist thought.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall)
WGST-352 Globalization and Gender through Chinese Cinema: From Kungfu to World Factory
This course surveys Chinese cinema from its beginning to the present with special attention to 
its transnational connections and gender representation. Films from the mainland, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong will be examined in-depth for their aesthetic quality and techniques, and equally 
important, against their socio-historical, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Topics 
include Kungfu films, women's cinema, documentation of globalization, independent film -
making and social activism, and more. The class is conducted in English. Assigned films will 
be in Chinese with English subtitles.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)WGST-357 Communication, Gender, and Media
This course examines the relationship between gender and media communication with specific 
attention to how gender affects choices in mass media and social media practices. Students 
explore how gender, sexual orientation, sexuality and social roles, affect media coverage, por -
trayals, production and reception. They consider issues of authorship, spectatorship (audience), 
and the ways in which various media content (film, television, print journalism, advertising, 
social media) enables, facilitates, and challenges these social constructions in society. The course 
covers communication theories and scholarship as it applies to gender and media, methods of 
media analysis, and topics of current interest.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Biannual)
WGST-361 Queering Gender
This course begins with the concept that sexuality, gender and gender identity is neither fixed 
nor innate. Many people who adopt a definition or expression of gender different from society 
often identify themselves as queer. The study of this movement is referred to as queer theory. 
This course examines the concepts of sex, gender, and gender expression of straight, gay, les -
bian, bisexual and transgender people of all ages, races, and socioeconomic classes within the 
context of the larger society in which we live. Students will explore the unique political, legal, 
and interpersonal challenges faced by those embracing queer identity as well as the diversity 
of gender identities and expressions.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-375 Women/Gender/Art
This course examines the role of women in the visual arts as both images makers and subject 
matter in order to see how gender plays a role in the conceptualization of creativity and art. 
Among the topics to be discussed are: the construction of femininity and gender in the patri -
archy; art as an ideological practice; women, art, and society; art history, art education, and art 
evaluation; women artists and their contemporaries.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-383 Traumatic Images
This course investigates visual culture and its imagistic response to life's crises. Problems of 
identity and identification will be explored and confronted through works of photography, 
painting, mixed media, new media and film of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Beginning 
with the late 19th Century vogue for images of hysterical women, crippled black-sheep fam -
ily members and dead loved ones (as corpses and as ghosts), we then move on to consider the 
last century's fascination with pain and suffering, disease and violence, struggle and survival 
and then the 21st century's emphasis on terrorism. Specifically, we will focus on the gender -
ing of images and imaging as disturbing pictures work to defy the formal and theoretical 
distinction between private and public, personal, and collective experience and manage the 
often conflicting responsibilities to self, family, religion, race, nation, and society.  Lecture 3, 
Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-384 Art of Dying
This course explores the experience of dying a profoundly human and universal experience 
as it is represented by artists who are themselves facing immanent death. The unique and 
deeply personal process of each dying artist is crucially informed by social, cultural and his -
torical as well as artistic contexts. The course will focus primarily on visual artists and writers 
living with and dying of disease - such as AIDS, cancer and cystic fibrosis as well as mortality 
and age. Topics such as aesthetics, artistic media, representation, grief, bereavement, illness, 
care-giving, aging, and the dying process will be considered within the context of issues of 
race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, gender and community values. Some of the artists covered 
will be Jo Spence, Hannah Wilke, Elias Canetti, Bob Flanagan, Herve Guibert, Tom Joslin, 
Laurie Lynd, Audre Lorde, Charlotte Salomon, Keith Haring, Frida Kahlo, Bas Jan Ader, Ted 
Rosenthal, Felix Gonzalez Torres, Keith Haring, Eric Steel, Derek Jarman, Eric Michaels, and 
David Wojnarowicz. We will also explore some of the critical theory of Roland Barthes, Michel 
Foucault, Elaine Scarry, Susan Sontag, and Ross Chambers.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)
WGST-388 Gender and Contemporary Art
This course traces the historical development of women’s activism in the art world from the 
1970s to the present. We will interpret how this art activism, which artists and scholars alike 
have referred to as the feminist art movement, has examined how gender informs the ways art 
is made, viewed, conceptualized in history and theory, and exhibited in museums and visual 
culture, in a range of cultural contexts. We will also analyze how current artists, critics, and 
curators continue to build on this history, in particular how they use the concept of gender 
intersectionality to develop a variety of new creative practices, theories, modes of exhibition 
and social engagement.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Fall, Spring) Undergraduate Course Descriptions  185
College of Liberal ArtsWGST-392 Queer and Transgender Creative Writing Workshop
This course is for students who want to practice and explore the vast and varied history, craft, 
and techniques of queer and transgender creative writing. Through reading and discussion, stu -
dents will contextualize their own writing in a vital lineage and in the contemporary moment. 
We will read, analyze, reflect, generate, write, edit, and revise throughout the semester. We 
will create a polished body of creative works by honing those stylistic and craft techniques gen -
eral to the field and specific to queer and transgender writers. Peer editors and group critiques 
will provide regular feedback, which will aid in the refinement of each writer’s own work and 
improve their capacity for supporting a creative work from germinating idea to final draft. 
Each class will rely extensively on the creative writing workshop model, and will survey the 
rich variety of genres, styles, forms, and philosophical approaches that QT literature takes.

HNRS-299 Civic Engagement and Resistance in Brazil
Brazil’s culture is vibrant and its natural resources are extensive, but the country continues to 
feel the effects of historical struggles related to the enduring effects of colonization and racism, 
wealth inequality and corruption, violence, and the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. This 
course will introduce students to a rich history of social movements that emerged in response 
to these struggles, including subversive movements in which resistance to authoritarian rule 
was expressed in music and embodied in dance. Focusing on the sociohistorical context of 
Brazil, students will learn analytic tools drawn from contemporary theories of collective action 
to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in society. We will consider the 
following questions: (1) What are the characteristics of successful social movements? (2) Why 
do everyday citizens choose to join social movements, often at high personal risk? (3) How 
and when have those movements achieved their goals, and what common obstacles have they 
faced? Students will identify key patterns in the social movements, and will explore similari -
ties between Brazilian and American examples of civic engagement and resistance. The class 
will meet regularly on the Rochester campus in the spring semester for discussions and assign -
ments. This course will conclude with a mandatory, 2-week study tour in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
to foster a deeper understanding of these issues and their contemporary international relevance. 
The trip will take place immediately following the end of the spring semester. Students will 
receive an “Incomplete” in the spring semester, which will be changed upon fulfillment of the 
travel requirement. Tuition is part of the full-time spring semester. A program fee is charged 
for the international travel, which includes the costs of airfare, transportation, meals, tours, 
lodging, and health insurance. (This class is restricted to students in the Honors program.)

SOIS-101 Individualized Study Seminar
The required gateway course for students enrolled in the School of Individualized Study. Course 
provides an opportunity for students to explore the nature and function of academic disciplines. 
Students will have opportunities to develop and refine their transversal, transferrable, and 21st 
century skill sets and their relationship to traditional curriculum and experiential learning. 
(APPLAS-BS, APPLAS-AAS)  Lecture 1, Credits 1 (Fall or Spring)
SOIS-128 Community Folklife
Students will learn about a variety of community-based cultural practices by engaging with 
international and regional examples of material culture, customs and rituals, and narrative 
traditions. Applying theoretical perspectives gained through readings and discussion, students 
will evaluate the way those traditions reflect class, gender, and ethnic identity. Students will 
also learn basic ethnographic research methods and document traditional cultural practices 
found in their own communities.  Lecture 3, Credits 3 (Spring)SOIS-201 Paradigms and Worldviews
This course examines how different paradigms and worldviews have shaped our understand -
ing of the world and life, from antiquity to the present. This course is exploratory in nature. In 
other words, we will question who we are, how we fit into the world, and what ideas seem to 
define the world in which we live. How have different cultures, nations, and regions viewed the 
world differently? What are scientific paradigms? What is the Postmodern or the Posthuman? 
How can a cosmopolitan society reconcile different attitudes and belief systems? What happens 
when disparate worldviews or conceptual schemes collide or are threatened with cultural, eco -
nomic, or political devastation? How should the individual relate to society? How should they 
relate to the environment? How have artists and writers addressed such questions? We will 
examine how these concepts have evolved in the modern era, especially, and how paradigms 
and worldviews have differed across the globe. Key authors and readings from the fields of

CGNS-421 Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence
Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence (AI). The develop -
ment of artificial neural networks was inspired by the knowledge gained from the study of brain 
functioning, with neuroscientists and psychologists, such as Donald Hebb, William McCulloch, 
and Geoff Hinton, contributing significantly to the establishment of the field. AI researchers 
aim to emulate human intelligence by building models and developing biologically-inspired 
architectures that can make decisions and solve problems in the same way that humans do. 
At the same time, artificial intelligence is increasingly used as a research tool in neuroscience 
to advance our understanding of how the human brain works and to accelerate neuroscience 
development. For example, by analyzing the massive amounts of experimental data on brain 
activity acquired using neuroimaging techniques, machine learning is used to uncover the 
patterns in brain activity and link them to specific cognitive and motor actions. This course 
reviews the fundamental ideas in computational neuroscience and connects the study of the 
brain to the concepts and research in artificial intelligence. The list of example topics includes 
neural coding, the biophysics of single neurons and neuron models, neural networks, biologi -

CGNS-501 Neuroscience Capstone I
Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence (AI). The develop -
ment of artificial neural networks was inspired by the knowledge gained from the study of brain 
functioning, with neuroscientists and psychologists, such as Donald Hebb, William McCulloch, 
and Geoff Hinton, contributing significantly to the establishment of the field. AI researchers 
aim to emulate human intelligence by building models and developing biologically-inspired 
architectures that can make decisions and solve problems in the same way that humans do. 
At the same time, artificial intelligence is increasingly used as a research tool in neuroscience 
to advance our understanding of how the human brain works and to accelerate neuroscience 
development. For example, by analyzing the massive amounts of experimental data on brain 
activity acquired using neuroimaging techniques, machine learning is used to uncover the 
patterns in brain activity and link them to specific cognitive and motor actions. This course 
reviews the fundamental ideas in computational neuroscience and connects the study of the 
brain to the concepts and research in artificial intelligence. The list of example topics includes 
neural coding, the biophysics of single neurons and neuron models, neural networks, biologi -
cal and computational vision, adaptation and learning, machine learning, deep convolutional 
networks, memory, speech and language processing, and applications of computational neu -
roscience and artificial intelligence.  Research 3, Credits 1 (Fall, Spring, Summer)

This course addresses issues of evaluating, detecting, and communicating about pseudoscience 
that scientists are likely to encounter in their careers. For example, some people use scientific 
evidence to promote their view that Earth is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and a 
heavily-guarded 150-foot-tall wall of ice called Antarctica around the rim. However, more and 
better scientific evidence is available to suggest that the Earth is approximately spherical. How 
does one distinguish between pseudoscience (Flat Earth) and science (Approximately Spherical

ITDS-354H  Honors Science Seminar: Data and Statistics: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Mark Twain popularized the saying "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and sta -
tistics." This course addresses the many ways that the seemingly objective processes of sample 
selection, data collection, analysis, and statistics can be subject to inadvertent or purposeful 
bias and have been used inappropriately to promote subjective (at best) and false (at worse) 
conclusions in the field of science. Students will explore topics in data collection, data sci -
ence, and basic statistical inference with an eye toward spotting flimsy statistical arguments.

Dance
WDAN-001 Ballet
Ballet is a form of dancing performed for theatre audiences. Like any other dance forms, ballet 
may tell a story, express a mood, or simply reflect the music. But a ballet dancer's technique 
(way of performing) and special skills differ greatly from those of other dancers. Ballet dancers 
perform many movements that are unnatural for the body, but when these movements are well 
executed, they look natural and beautiful. The beginner section is for students with 0-4 years 
of formal training. The intermediate/advanced section is for students with 5 or more years of 
formal training. Both sections will focus on the various ballet movements, from the very fun -
damental to more complex movements, poses and classical styles. **Fee: A course fee applied 
via SFS bill. See Course Notes for course fee information.**  Activity, Credits 0 (Fall, Spring)

Futsal is a modified form of soccer played on an indoor court with boundaries. It is different

are slightly different than traditional soccer such as there are no throw-ins, just kick-ins. The 
main difference is the ball is weighted and a size 4, slightly smaller with bounce restriction. This 
game is played with only 5 players on each side. Having a slightly smaller ball with less bounce 
allows for a much faster game which will increase foot skill speed and reaction time. Players 
contact the ball more, and improve their quick, short passes. **Fee: A course fee applied via
